# Installing an Operator from a catalog in OLM 1.0 (Technology Preview)


Cluster administrators can add catalogs, or curated collections of Operators and Kubernetes extensions, to their clusters. Operator authors publish their products to these catalogs. When you add a catalog to your cluster, you have access to the versions, patches, and over-the-air updates of the Operators and extensions that are published to the catalog.
In the current Technology Preview release of Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) 1.0, you manage catalogs and Operators declaratively from the CLI using custom resources (CRs).

[IMPORTANT]
----
OLM 1.0 is a Technology Preview feature only. Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete. Red Hat does not recommend using them in production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.
For more information about the support scope of Red Hat Technology Preview features, see Technology Preview Features Support Scope.
----

# Prerequisites

* Access to an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster using an account with cluster-admin permissions

[NOTE]
----
For Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.16, documented procedures for OLM 1.0 are CLI-based only. Alternatively, administrators can create and view related objects in the web console by using normal methods, such as the Import YAML and Search pages. However, the existing OperatorHub and Installed Operators pages do not yet display OLM 1.0 components.
----
* The TechPreviewNoUpgrade feature set enabled on the cluster

[WARNING]
----
Enabling the TechPreviewNoUpgrade feature set cannot be undone and prevents minor version updates. These feature sets are not recommended on production clusters.
----
* The OpenShift CLI (oc) installed on your workstation

* Enabling features using feature gates

# About catalogs in OLM 1.0

You can discover installable content by querying a catalog for Kubernetes extensions, such as Operators and controllers, by using the catalogd component. Catalogd is a Kubernetes extension that unpacks catalog content for on-cluster clients and is part of the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) 1.0 suite of microservices. Currently, catalogd unpacks catalog content that is packaged and distributed as container images.


[IMPORTANT]
----
If you try to install an Operator or extension that does not have unique name, the installation might fail or lead to an unpredictable result. This occurs for the following reasons:
* If mulitple catalogs are installed on a cluster, OLM 1.0 does not include a mechanism to specify a catalog when you install an Operator or extension.
* Dependency resolution in Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) 1.0 requires that all of the Operators and extensions that are available to install on a cluster use a unique name for their bundles and packages.
----

* File-based catalogs

# Red Hat-provided Operator catalogs in OLM 1.0

Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) 1.0 does not include Red Hat-provided Operator catalogs by default. If you want to add a Red Hat-provided catalog to your cluster, create a custom resource (CR) for the catalog and apply it to the cluster. The following custom resource (CR) examples show how to create a catalog resources for OLM 1.0.


[IMPORTANT]
----
If you want to use a catalog that is hosted on a secure registry, such as Red Hat-provided Operator catalogs from registry.redhat.io, you must have a pull secret scoped to the openshift-catalogd namespace.
For more information, see "Creating a pull secret for catalogs hosted on a secure registry".
----


```yaml
apiVersion: catalogd.operatorframework.io/v1alpha1
kind: Catalog
metadata:
  name: redhat-operators
spec:
  source:
    type: image
    image:
      ref: registry.redhat.io/redhat/redhat-operator-index:v4.16
      pullSecret: <pull_secret_name>
      pollInterval: <poll_interval_duration> 1
```


Specify the interval for polling the remote registry for newer image digests. The default value is 24h. Valid units include seconds (s), minutes (m), and hours (h). To disable polling, set a zero value, such as 0s.


```yaml
apiVersion: catalogd.operatorframework.io/v1alpha1
kind: Catalog
metadata:
  name: certified-operators
spec:
  source:
    type: image
    image:

      pullSecret: <pull_secret_name>
      pollInterval: 24h
```


The following command adds a catalog to your cluster:


```terminal
$ oc apply -f <catalog_name>.yaml 1
```


Specifies the catalog CR, such as redhat-operators.yaml.

# Creating a pull secret for catalogs hosted on a secure registry

If you want to use a catalog that is hosted on a secure registry, such as Red Hat-provided Operator catalogs from registry.redhat.io, you must have a pull secret scoped to the openshift-catalogd namespace.


[NOTE]
----
Currently, catalogd cannot read global pull secrets from Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform clusters. Catalogd can read references to secrets only in the namespace where it is deployed.
----

* Login credentials for the secure registry
* Docker or Podman installed on your workstation

* If you already have a .dockercfg file with login credentials for the secure registry, create a pull secret by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc create secret generic <pull_secret_name> \
    --from-file=.dockercfg=<file_path>/.dockercfg \
    --type=kubernetes.io/dockercfg \
    --namespace=openshift-catalogd
```

Example command

```terminal
$ oc create secret generic redhat-cred \
    --from-file=.dockercfg=/home/<username>/.dockercfg \
    --type=kubernetes.io/dockercfg \
    --namespace=openshift-catalogd
```
* If you already have a $HOME/.docker/config.json file with login credentials for the secured registry, create a pull secret by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc create secret generic <pull_secret_name> \
    --from-file=.dockerconfigjson=<file_path>/.docker/config.json \
    --type=kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson \
    --namespace=openshift-catalogd
```

Example command

```terminal
$ oc create secret generic redhat-cred \
    --from-file=.dockerconfigjson=/home/<username>/.docker/config.json \
    --type=kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson \
    --namespace=openshift-catalogd
```
* If you do not have a Docker configuration file with login credentials for the secure registry, create a pull secret by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc create secret docker-registry <pull_secret_name> \
    --docker-server=<registry_server> \
    --docker-username=<username> \
    --docker-password=<password> \
    --docker-email=<email> \
    --namespace=openshift-catalogd
```

Example command

```terminal
$ oc create secret docker-registry redhat-cred \
    --docker-server=registry.redhat.io \
    --docker-username=username \
    --docker-password=password \
    --docker-email=user@example.com \
    --namespace=openshift-catalogd
```

# Adding a catalog to a cluster

To add a catalog to a cluster, create a catalog custom resource (CR) and apply it to the cluster.

* 
If you want to use a catalog that is hosted on a secure registry, such as Red Hat-provided Operator catalogs from registry.redhat.io, you must have a pull secret scoped to the openshift-catalogd namespace.
For more information, see "Creating a pull secret for catalogs hosted on a secure registry".

1. Create a catalog custom resource (CR), similar to the following example:
Example redhat-operators.yaml

```yaml
apiVersion: catalogd.operatorframework.io/v1alpha1
kind: Catalog
metadata:
  name: redhat-operators
spec:
  source:
    type: image
    image:
      ref: registry.redhat.io/redhat/redhat-operator-index:v4.16 1
      pullSecret: <pull_secret_name> 2
      pollInterval: <poll_interval_duration> 3
```

Specify the catalog's image in the spec.source.image field.
If your catalog is hosted on a secure registry, such as registry.redhat.io, you must create a pull secret scoped to the openshift-catalog namespace.
Specify the interval for polling the remote registry for newer image digests. The default value is 24h. Valid units include seconds (s), minutes (m), and hours (h). To disable polling, set a zero value, such as 0s.
2. Add the catalog to your cluster by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f redhat-operators.yaml
```

Example output

```text
catalog.catalogd.operatorframework.io/redhat-operators created
```


* Run the following commands to verify the status of your catalog:
1. Check if you catalog is available by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get catalog
```

Example output

```text

redhat-operators      20s
```

2. Check the status of your catalog by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc describe catalog

# Finding Operators to install from a catalog

After you add a catalog to your cluster, you can query the catalog to find Operators and extensions to install. Before you can query catalogs, you must port forward the catalog server service.

* You have added a catalog to your cluster.
* You have installed the jq CLI tool.

1. Port forward the catalog server service in the openshift-catalogd namespace by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc -n openshift-catalogd port-forward svc/catalogd-catalogserver 8080:80
```

2. Download the catalog's JSON file locally by running the following command:

```terminal
$ curl -L http://localhost:8080/catalogs/<catalog_name>/all.json \
  -C - -o /<path>/<catalog_name>.json
```

Example command

```terminal
$ curl -L http://localhost:8080/catalogs/redhat-operators/all.json \
  -C - -o /home/username/catalogs/rhoc.json
```
3. Run one of the following commands to return a list of Operators and extensions in a catalog.

[IMPORTANT]
----
Currently, Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) 1.0 supports extensions that do not use webhooks and are configured to use the AllNamespaces install mode. Extensions that use webhooks or that target a single or specified set of namespaces cannot be installed.
----
* Get a list of all the Operators and extensions from the local catalog file by running the following command:

```terminal
$ jq -s '.[] | select(.schema == "olm.package") | .name' \
  /<path>/<filename>.json
```

Example command

```terminal
$ jq -s '.[] | select(.schema == "olm.package") | .name' \
  /home/username/catalogs/rhoc.json
```
Example output

```text
NAME                                                        AGE
"3scale-operator"

"aws-load-balancer-operator"
"bamoe-businessautomation-operator"
"bamoe-kogito-operator"
"bare-metal-event-relay"
"businessautomation-operator"
...
```
* Get list of packages that support AllNamespaces install mode and do not use webhooks from the local catalog file by running the following command:

```terminal
$ jq -c 'select(.schema == "olm.bundle") | \
  {"package":.package, "version":.properties[] | \
  select(.type == "olm.bundle.object").value.data | @base64d | fromjson | \
  select(.kind == "ClusterServiceVersion" and (.spec.installModes[] | \
  select(.type == "AllNamespaces" and .supported == true) != null) \
  and .spec.webhookdefinitions == null).spec.version}' \
  /<path>/<catalog_name>.json
```

Example output

```text
{"package":"3scale-operator","version":"0.10.0-mas"}
{"package":"3scale-operator","version":"0.10.5"}
{"package":"3scale-operator","version":"0.11.0-mas"}
{"package":"3scale-operator","version":"0.11.1-mas"}
{"package":"3scale-operator","version":"0.11.2-mas"}
{"package":"3scale-operator","version":"0.11.3-mas"}
{"package":"3scale-operator","version":"0.11.5-mas"}
{"package":"3scale-operator","version":"0.11.6-mas"}
{"package":"3scale-operator","version":"0.11.7-mas"}
{"package":"3scale-operator","version":"0.11.8-mas"}
{"package":"amq-broker-rhel8","version":"7.10.0-opr-1"}

{"package":"amq-broker-rhel8","version":"7.10.0-opr-3"}
{"package":"amq-broker-rhel8","version":"7.10.0-opr-4"}
{"package":"amq-broker-rhel8","version":"7.10.1-opr-1"}
{"package":"amq-broker-rhel8","version":"7.10.1-opr-2"}
{"package":"amq-broker-rhel8","version":"7.10.2-opr-1"}
{"package":"amq-broker-rhel8","version":"7.10.2-opr-2"}
...
```
4. Inspect the contents of an Operator or extension's metadata by running the following command:

```terminal
$ jq -s '.[] | select( .schema == "olm.package") | \
  select( .name == "<package_name>")' /<path>/<catalog_name>.json
```

Example command

```terminal
$ jq -s '.[] | select( .schema == "olm.package") | \
  select( .name == "openshift-pipelines-operator-rh")' \
  /home/username/rhoc.json
```
Example output

```text
{
  "defaultChannel": "stable",
  "icon": {
    "base64data": "PHN2ZyB4bWxu..."
    "mediatype": "image/png"
  },
  "name": "openshift-pipelines-operator-rh",
  "schema": "olm.package"
}
```

## Common catalog queries

You can query catalogs by using the jq CLI tool.







# Installing a cluster extension from a catalog

Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) 1.0 supports installing cluster extensions, including legacy OLM Operators via the registry+v1 bundle format, that are scoped to the cluster. You can install an extension from a catalog by creating a custom resource (CR) and applying it to the cluster.


[IMPORTANT]
----
Currently, OLM 1.0 supports the installation of extensions that meet the following criteria:
* The extension must use the AllNamespaces install mode.
* The extension must not use webhooks.
Cluster extensions that use webhooks or that target a single or specified set of namespaces cannot be installed.
----

* You have added a catalog to your cluster.
* You have downloaded a local copy of the catalog file.
* You have installed the jq CLI tool.

1. Inspect a package for channel and version information from a local copy of your catalog file by completing the following steps:
1. Get a list of channels from a selected package by running the following command:

```terminal
$ jq -s '.[] | select( .schema == "olm.channel" ) | \
  select( .package == "<package_name>") | \
  .name' /<path>/<catalog_name>.json
```

Example command

```terminal
$ jq -s '.[] | select( .schema == "olm.channel" ) | \
  select( .package == "openshift-pipelines-operator-rh") | \
  .name' /home/username/rhoc.json
```
Example output

```text
"latest"
"pipelines-1.11"
"pipelines-1.12"
"pipelines-1.13"
"pipelines-1.14"
```
2. Get a list of the versions published in a channel by running the following command:

```terminal
$ jq -s '.[] | select( .package == "<package_name>" ) | \
  select( .schema == "olm.channel" ) | \
  select( .name == "<channel_name>" ) | .entries | \
  .[] | .name' /<path>/<catalog_name>.json
```

Example command

```terminal
$ jq -s '.[] | select( .package == "openshift-pipelines-operator-rh" ) | \
select( .schema == "olm.channel" ) | select( .name == "latest" ) | \
.entries | .[] | .name' /home/username/rhoc.json
```
Example output

```text
"openshift-pipelines-operator-rh.v1.12.0"
"openshift-pipelines-operator-rh.v1.12.1"
"openshift-pipelines-operator-rh.v1.12.2"
"openshift-pipelines-operator-rh.v1.13.0"
"openshift-pipelines-operator-rh.v1.13.1"
"openshift-pipelines-operator-rh.v1.11.1"
"openshift-pipelines-operator-rh.v1.12.0"
"openshift-pipelines-operator-rh.v1.12.1"
"openshift-pipelines-operator-rh.v1.12.2"
"openshift-pipelines-operator-rh.v1.13.0"
"openshift-pipelines-operator-rh.v1.14.1"
"openshift-pipelines-operator-rh.v1.14.2"
"openshift-pipelines-operator-rh.v1.14.3"
"openshift-pipelines-operator-rh.v1.14.4"
```
2. If you want to install your extension into a new namespace, run the following command:

```terminal
$ oc adm new-project <new_namespace>
```

3. Create a CR, similar to the following example:
Example pipelines-operator.yaml CR

```yaml
apiVersion: olm.operatorframework.io/v1alpha1
kind: ClusterExtension
metadata:
  name: pipelines-operator
spec:
  packageName: openshift-pipelines-operator-rh
  installNamespace: <namespace>
  channel: <channel>
  version: "<version>"
```


where:
<namespace>:: Specifies the namespace where you want the bundle installed, such as openshift-operators or my-extension. Extensions are still cluster-scoped and might contain resources that are installed in different namespaces.
<channel>:: Optional: Specifies the channel, such as pipelines-1.11 or latest, for the package you want to install or update.
<version>:: Optional: Specifies the version or version range, such as 1.11.1, 1.12.x, or >=1.12.1, of the package you want to install or update. For more information, see "Example custom resources (CRs) that specify a target version" and "Support for version ranges".

[IMPORTANT]
----
If you try to install an Operator or extension that does not have unique name, the installation might fail or lead to an unpredictable result. This occurs for the following reasons:
* If mulitple catalogs are installed on a cluster, OLM 1.0 does not include a mechanism to specify a catalog when you install an Operator or extension.
* Dependency resolution in Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) 1.0 requires that all of the Operators and extensions that are available to install on a cluster use a unique name for their bundles and packages.
----
4. Apply the CR to the cluster by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f pipeline-operator.yaml
```

Example output

```text
clusterextension.olm.operatorframework.io/pipelines-operator created
```


1. View the Operator or extension's CR in the YAML format by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get clusterextension pipelines-operator -o yaml
```

Example output

# Updating a cluster extension

You can update your cluster extension or Operator by manually editing the custom resource (CR) and applying the changes.

* You have a catalog installed.
* You have downloaded a local copy of the catalog file.
* You have an Operator or extension installed.
* You have installed the jq CLI tool.

1. Inspect a package for channel and version information from a local copy of your catalog file by completing the following steps:
1. Get a list of channels from a selected package by running the following command:

```terminal
$ jq -s '.[] | select( .schema == "olm.channel" ) | \
  select( .package == "<package_name>") | \
  .name' /<path>/<catalog_name>.json
```

Example command

```terminal
$ jq -s '.[] | select( .schema == "olm.channel" ) | \
  select( .package == "openshift-pipelines-operator-rh") | \
  .name' /home/username/rhoc.json
```
Example output

```text
"latest"
"pipelines-1.11"
"pipelines-1.12"
"pipelines-1.13"
"pipelines-1.14"
```
2. Get a list of the versions published in a channel by running the following command:

```terminal
$ jq -s '.[] | select( .package == "<package_name>" ) | \
  select( .schema == "olm.channel" ) | \
  select( .name == "<channel_name>" ) | .entries | \
  .[] | .name' /<path>/<catalog_name>.json
```

Example command

```terminal
$ jq -s '.[] | select( .package == "openshift-pipelines-operator-rh" ) | \
select( .schema == "olm.channel" ) | select( .name == "latest" ) | \
.entries | .[] | .name' /home/username/rhoc.json
```
Example output

```text
"openshift-pipelines-operator-rh.v1.11.1"
"openshift-pipelines-operator-rh.v1.12.0"
"openshift-pipelines-operator-rh.v1.12.1"
"openshift-pipelines-operator-rh.v1.12.2"
"openshift-pipelines-operator-rh.v1.13.0"
"openshift-pipelines-operator-rh.v1.14.1"
"openshift-pipelines-operator-rh.v1.14.2"
"openshift-pipelines-operator-rh.v1.14.3"
"openshift-pipelines-operator-rh.v1.14.4"
```
2. Find out what version or channel is specified in your Operator or extension's CR by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get clusterextension <operator_name> -o yaml
```

Example command

```terminal
$ oc get clusterextension pipelines-operator -o yaml
```

```
3. Edit your CR by using one of the following methods:
* If you want to pin your Operator or extension to specific version, such as 1.12.1, edit your CR similar to the following example:
Example pipelines-operator.yaml CR

```yaml
apiVersion: olm.operatorframework.io/v1alpha1
kind: ClusterExtension
metadata:
  name: pipelines-operator
spec:
  packageName: openshift-pipelines-operator-rh
  installNamespace: <namespace>
  version: "1.12.1" 1
```

Update the version from 1.11.1 to 1.12.1
* If you want to define a range of acceptable update versions, edit your CR similar to the following example:
Example CR with a version range specified

```yaml
apiVersion: olm.operatorframework.io/v1alpha1
kind: ClusterExtension
metadata:
  name: pipelines-operator
spec:
  packageName: openshift-pipelines-operator-rh
  installNamespace: <namespace>
  version: ">1.11.1, <1.13" 1
```

Specifies that the desired version range is greater than version 1.11.1 and less than 1.13. For more information, see "Support for version ranges" and "Version comparison strings".
* If you want to update to the latest version that can be resolved from a channel, edit your CR similar to the following example:
Example CR with a specified channel

```yaml
apiVersion: olm.operatorframework.io/v1alpha1
kind: ClusterExtension
metadata:
  name: pipelines-operator
spec:
  packageName: openshift-pipelines-operator-rh
  installNamespace: <namespace>
  channel: pipelines-1.13 1
```

Installs the latest release that can be resolved from the specified channel. Updates to the channel are automatically installed.
* If you want to specify a channel and version or version range, edit your CR similar to the following example:
Example CR with a specified channel and version range

```yaml
apiVersion: olm.operatorframework.io/v1alpha1
kind: ClusterExtension
metadata:
  name: pipelines-operator
spec:
  packageName: openshift-pipelines-operator-rh
  installNamespace: <namespace>
  channel: latest
  version: "<1.13"
```


For more information, see "Example custom resources (CRs) that specify a target version".
4. Apply the update to the cluster by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f pipelines-operator.yaml
```

Example output

```text
clusterextension.olm.operatorframework.io/pipelines-operator configured
```


[TIP]
----
You can patch and apply the changes to your CR from the CLI by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc patch clusterextension/pipelines-operator -p \
  '{"spec":{"version":"<1.13"}}' \
  --type=merge
```


```text
clusterextension.olm.operatorframework.io/pipelines-operator patched
```

----

* Verify that the channel and version updates have been applied by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get clusterextension pipelines-operator -o yaml
```

# Upgrade constraint semantics

When determining upgrade edges for an installed cluster extension, Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) 1.0 supports legacy OLM semantics starting in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.16. This support follows the behavior from legacy OLM, including replaces, skips, and skipRange directives, with a few noted differences.

By supporting legacy OLM semantics, OLM 1.0 now honors the upgrade graph from catalogs accurately.

* If there are multiple possible successors, OLM 1.0 behavior differs in the following ways:
* In legacy OLM, the successor closest to the channel head is chosen.
* In OLM 1.0, the successor with the highest semantic version (semver) is chosen.
* Consider the following set of file-based catalog (FBC) channel entries:

```yaml
# ...
- name: example.v3.0.0
  skips: ["example.v2.0.0"]
- name: example.v2.0.0
  skipRange: >=1.0.0 <2.0.0
```


If 1.0.0 is installed, OLM 1.0 behavior differs in the following ways:
* Legacy OLM will not see an upgrade edge to v2.0.0 because v2.0.0 is skipped and not on the replaces chain.
* OLM 1.0 will see the upgrade edge because OLM 1.0 does not have a concept of a replaces chain. OLM 1.0 finds all entries that have a replace, skip, or skipRange value that covers the currently installed version.


[NOTE]
----
Support for semantic versioning (semver) upgrade constraints was introduced in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.15 but disabled in 4.16 in favor of legacy OLM semantics during this Technology Preview phase.
----

* Legacy OLM upgrade semantics

## Support for version ranges

In Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) 1.0, you can specify a version range by using a comparison string in an Operator or extension&#8217;s custom resource (CR). If you specify a version range in the CR, OLM 1.0 installs or updates to the latest version of the Operator that can be resolved within the version range.

* The resolved version is the latest version of the Operator that satisfies the dependencies and constraints of the Operator and the environment.
* An Operator update within the specified range is automatically installed if it is resolved successfully.
* An update is not installed if it is outside of the specified range or if it cannot be resolved successfully.

For more information about dependency and constraint resolution in OLM 1.0, see "Dependency resolution in OLM 1.0".

* Dependency resolution in OLM 1.0

## Version comparison strings

You can define a version range by adding a comparison string to the spec.version field in an Operator or extension&#8217;s custom resource (CR). A comparison string is a list of space- or comma-separated values and one or more comparison operators enclosed in double quotation marks ("). You can add another comparison string by including an OR, or double vertical bar (||), comparison operator between the strings.



You can specify a version range in an Operator or extension&#8217;s CR by using a range comparison similar to the following example:


```yaml
apiVersion: olm.operatorframework.io/v1alpha1
kind: ClusterExtension
metadata:
  name: pipelines-operator
spec:
  packageName: openshift-pipelines-operator-rh
  installNamespace: <namespace_name>
  version: ">=1.11, <1.13"
```


You can use wildcard characters in all types of comparison strings. OLM 1.0 accepts x, X, and asterisks (*) as wildcard characters. When you use a wildcard character with the equal sign (=) comparison operator, you define a comparison at the patch or minor version level.



You can make patch release comparisons by using the tilde (~) comparison operator. Patch release comparisons specify a minor version up to the next major version.



You can use the caret (^) comparison operator to make a comparison for a major release. If you make a major release comparison before the first stable release is published, the minor versions define the API&#8217;s level of stability. In the semantic versioning (semver) specification, the first stable release is published as the 1.0.0 version.



## Example custom resources (CRs) that specify a target version

In Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) 1.0, cluster administrators can declaratively set the target version of an Operator or extension in the custom resource (CR).

You can define a target version by specifying any of the following fields:

* Channel
* Version number
* Version range

If you specify a channel in the CR, OLM 1.0 installs the latest version of the Operator or extension that can be resolved within the specified channel. When updates are published to the specified channel, OLM 1.0 automatically updates to the latest release that can be resolved from the channel.


```yaml
apiVersion: olm.operatorframework.io/v1alpha1
kind: ClusterExtension
metadata:
  name: pipelines-operator
spec:
  packageName: openshift-pipelines-operator-rh
  installNamespace: <namespace_name>
  channel: latest 1
```


Installs the latest release that can be resolved from the specified channel. Updates to the channel are automatically installed.

If you specify the Operator or extension&#8217;s target version in the CR, OLM 1.0 installs the specified version. When the target version is specified in the CR, OLM 1.0 does not change the target version when updates are published to the catalog.

If you want to update the version of the Operator that is installed on the cluster, you must manually edit the Operator&#8217;s CR. Specifying an Operator&#8217;s target version pins the Operator&#8217;s version to the specified release.


```yaml
apiVersion: olm.operatorframework.io/v1alpha1
kind: ClusterExtension
metadata:
  name: pipelines-operator
spec:
  packageName: openshift-pipelines-operator-rh
  installNamespace: <namespace_name>
  version: "1.11.1" 1
```


Specifies the target version. If you want to update the version of the Operator or extension that is installed, you must manually update this field the CR to the desired target version.

If you want to define a range of acceptable versions for an Operator or extension, you can specify a version range by using a comparison string. When you specify a version range, OLM 1.0 installs the latest version of an Operator or extension that can be resolved by the Operator Controller.


```yaml
apiVersion: olm.operatorframework.io/v1alpha1
kind: ClusterExtension
metadata:
  name: pipelines-operator
spec:
  packageName: openshift-pipelines-operator-rh
  installNamespace: <namespace_name>
  version: ">1.11.1" 1
```


Specifies that the desired version range is greater than version 1.11.1. For more information, see "Support for version ranges".

After you create or update a CR, apply the configuration file by running the following command:


```terminal
$ oc apply -f <extension_name>.yaml
```


## Forcing an update or rollback

OLM 1.0 does not support automatic updates to the next major version or rollbacks to an earlier version. If you want to perform a major version update or rollback, you must verify and force the update manually.


[WARNING]
----
You must verify the consequences of forcing a manual update or rollback. Failure to verify a forced update or rollback might have catastrophic consequences such as data loss.
----

* You have a catalog installed.
* You have an Operator or extension installed.

1. Edit the custom resource (CR) of your Operator or extension as shown in the following example:
Example CR

```yaml
apiVersion: olm.operatorframework.io/v1alpha1
kind: Operator
metadata:
  name: <operator_name> 1
spec:
  packageName: <package_name> 2
  installNamespace: <namespace_name>
  version: <version> 3
  upgradeConstraintPolicy: Ignore 4
```

Specifies the name of the Operator or extension, such as pipelines-operator
Specifies the package name, such as openshift-pipelines-operator-rh.
Specifies the blocked update or rollback version.
Optional: Specifies the upgrade constraint policy. To force an update or rollback, set the field to Ignore. If unspecified, the default setting is Enforce.
2. Apply the changes to your Operator or extensions CR by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f <extension_name>.yaml
```
