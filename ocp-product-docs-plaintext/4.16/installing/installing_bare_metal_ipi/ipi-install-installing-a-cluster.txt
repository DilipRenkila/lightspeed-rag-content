# Installing a cluster



# Deploying the cluster via the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installer

Run the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installer:


```terminal
$ ./openshift-baremetal-install --dir ~/clusterconfigs --log-level debug create cluster
```


# Following the progress of the installation

During the deployment process, you can check the installation&#8217;s overall status by issuing the tail command to the .openshift_install.log log file in the install directory folder:


```terminal
$ tail -f /path/to/install-dir/.openshift_install.log
```


# Verifying static IP address configuration

If the DHCP reservation for a cluster node specifies an infinite lease, after the installer successfully provisions the node, the dispatcher script checks the node&#8217;s network configuration. If the script determines that the network configuration contains an infinite DHCP lease, it creates a new connection using the IP address of the DHCP lease as a static IP address.


[NOTE]
----
The dispatcher script might run on successfully provisioned nodes while the provisioning of other nodes in the cluster is ongoing.
----

Verify the network configuration is working properly.

1. Check the network interface configuration on the node.
2. Turn off the DHCP server and reboot the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform node and ensure that the network configuration works properly.

# Preparing to reinstall a cluster on bare metal

Before you reinstall a cluster on bare metal, you must perform cleanup operations.

1. Remove or reformat the disks for the bootstrap, control plane node, and compute nodes. If you are working in a hypervisor environment, you must add any disks you removed.
2. Delete the artifacts that the previous installation generated:

```terminal
$ cd ; /bin/rm -rf auth/ bootstrap.ign master.ign worker.ign metadata.json \
.openshift_install.log .openshift_install_state.json
```

3. Generate new manifests and Ignition config files. See â€œCreating the Kubernetes manifest and Ignition config files" for more information.
4. Upload the new bootstrap, control plane, and compute node Ignition config files that the installation program created to your HTTP server. This will overwrite the previous Ignition files.
