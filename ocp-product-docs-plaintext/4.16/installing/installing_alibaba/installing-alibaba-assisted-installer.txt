# Converting the discovery image to QCOW2 format

Convert the generated ISO to QCOW2 format before importing it into Alibaba Cloud.

* You have created a cluster and downloaded the discovery image in the Assisted Installer.
* You have access to a Red Hat Enterprise Linux or Fedora machine that is outside the cluster, such as your desktop machine.
* You have ensured that the machine has virtualization flags enabled.

1. Open the command line interface on your RHEL or Fedora machine.
2. Verify that qemu-img is installed on the machine by running the following command:

```terminal
$ sudo dnf install -y qemu-img
```

3. Convert the image to QCOW2 by running the following command:

```terminal
$ qemu-img convert -O qcow2 ${CLUSTER_NAME}.iso ${CLUSTER_NAME}.qcow2
```
