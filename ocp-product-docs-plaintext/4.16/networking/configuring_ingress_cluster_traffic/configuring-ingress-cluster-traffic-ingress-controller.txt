# Configuring ingress cluster traffic using an Ingress Controller


Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform provides methods for communicating from outside the cluster with
services running in the cluster. This method uses an Ingress Controller.

# Creating a project and service

If the project and service that you want to expose do not exist, first create
the project, then the service.

If the project and service already exist, skip to the procedure on exposing the
service to create a route.

* Install the oc CLI and log in as a cluster administrator.

1. Create a new project for your service by running the oc new-project command:

```terminal
$ oc new-project myproject
```

2. Use the oc new-app command to create your service:

```terminal
$ oc new-app nodejs:12~https://github.com/sclorg/nodejs-ex.git
```

3. To verify that the service was created, run the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get svc -n myproject
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME        TYPE        CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
nodejs-ex   ClusterIP   172.30.197.157   <none>        8080/TCP   70s
```


By default, the new service does not have an external IP address.

# Exposing the service by creating a route

You can expose the service as a route by using the oc expose command.

To expose the service:

1. Log in to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.
2. Log in to the project where the service you want to expose is located:

```terminal
$ oc project myproject
```

3. Run the oc expose service command to expose the route:

```terminal
$ oc expose service nodejs-ex
```

Example output

```terminal
route.route.openshift.io/nodejs-ex exposed
```

4. To verify that the service is exposed, you can use a tool, such as cURL, to make sure the service is accessible from outside the cluster.
1. Use the oc get route command to find the route's host name:

```terminal
$ oc get route
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME        HOST/PORT                        PATH   SERVICES    PORT       TERMINATION   WILDCARD
nodejs-ex   nodejs-ex-myproject.example.com         nodejs-ex   8080-tcp                 None
```

2. Use cURL to check that the host responds to a GET request:

```terminal
$ curl --head nodejs-ex-myproject.example.com
```

Example output

```terminal
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
...
```


# Ingress Controller endpoint publishing strategy

NodePortService endpoint publishing strategy

The NodePortService endpoint publishing strategy publishes the Ingress Controller using a Kubernetes NodePort service.

In this configuration, the Ingress Controller deployment uses container networking. A NodePortService is created to publish the deployment. The specific node ports are dynamically allocated by Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform; however, to support static port allocations, your changes to the node port field of the managed NodePortService are preserved.

![Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform Ingress NodePort endpoint publishing strategy]

The preceding graphic shows the following concepts pertaining to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform Ingress NodePort endpoint publishing strategy:

* All the available nodes in the cluster have their own, externally accessible IP addresses. The service running in the cluster is bound to the unique NodePort for all the nodes.
* When the client connects to a node that is down, for example, by connecting the 10.0.128.4 IP address in the graphic, the node port directly connects the client to an available node that is running the service. In this scenario, no load balancing is required. As the image shows, the 10.0.128.4 address is down and another IP address must be used instead.


[NOTE]
----
The Ingress Operator ignores any updates to .spec.ports[].nodePort fields of the service.
By default, ports are allocated automatically and you can access the port allocations for integrations. However, sometimes static port allocations are necessary to integrate with existing infrastructure which may not be easily reconfigured in response to dynamic ports. To achieve integrations with static node ports, you can update the managed service resource directly.
----

For more information, see the Kubernetes Services documentation on NodePort.

HostNetwork endpoint publishing strategy

The HostNetwork endpoint publishing strategy publishes the Ingress Controller on node ports where the Ingress Controller is deployed.

An Ingress Controller with the HostNetwork endpoint publishing strategy can have only one pod replica per node. If you want n replicas, you must use at least n nodes where those replicas can be scheduled. Because each pod replica requests ports 80 and 443 on the node host where it is scheduled, a replica cannot be scheduled to a node if another pod on the same node is using those ports.

The HostNetwork object has a hostNetwork field with the following default values for the optional binding ports: httpPort: 80, httpsPort: 443, and statsPort: 1936. By specifying different binding ports for your network, you can deploy multiple Ingress Controllers on the same node for the HostNetwork strategy.


```yaml
apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1
kind: IngressController
metadata:
  name: internal
  namespace: openshift-ingress-operator
spec:
  domain: example.com
  endpointPublishingStrategy:
    type: HostNetwork
    hostNetwork:
      httpPort: 80
      httpsPort: 443
      statsPort: 1936
```


## Configuring the Ingress Controller endpoint publishing scope to Internal

When a cluster administrator installs a new cluster without specifying that the cluster is private, the default Ingress Controller is created with a scope set to External. Cluster administrators can change an External scoped Ingress Controller to Internal.

* You installed the oc CLI.

* To change an External scoped Ingress Controller to Internal, enter the following command:

```terminal
$ oc -n openshift-ingress-operator patch ingresscontrollers/default --type=merge --patch='{"spec":{"endpointPublishingStrategy":{"type":"LoadBalancerService","loadBalancer":{"scope":"Internal"}}}}'
```

* To check the status of the Ingress Controller, enter the following command:

```terminal
$ oc -n openshift-ingress-operator get ingresscontrollers/default -o yaml
```

* The Progressing status condition indicates whether you must take further action. For example, the status condition can indicate that you need to delete the service by entering the following command:

```terminal
$ oc -n openshift-ingress delete services/router-default
```


If you delete the service, the Ingress Operator recreates it as Internal.

## Configuring the Ingress Controller endpoint publishing scope to External

When a cluster administrator installs a new cluster without specifying that the cluster is private, the default Ingress Controller is created with a scope set to External.

The Ingress Controller&#8217;s scope can be configured to be Internal during installation or after, and cluster administrators can change an Internal Ingress Controller to External.


[IMPORTANT]
----
On some platforms, it is necessary to delete and recreate the service.
Changing the scope can cause disruption to Ingress traffic, potentially for several minutes. This applies to platforms where it is necessary to delete and recreate the service, because the procedure can cause Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform to deprovision the existing service load balancer, provision a new one, and update DNS.
----

* You installed the oc CLI.

* To change an Internal scoped Ingress Controller to External, enter the following command:

```terminal
$ oc -n openshift-ingress-operator patch ingresscontrollers/private --type=merge --patch='{"spec":{"endpointPublishingStrategy":{"type":"LoadBalancerService","loadBalancer":{"scope":"External"}}}}'
```

* To check the status of the Ingress Controller, enter the following command:

```terminal
$ oc -n openshift-ingress-operator get ingresscontrollers/default -o yaml
```

* The Progressing status condition indicates whether you must take further action. For example, the status condition can indicate that you need to delete the service by entering the following command:

```terminal
$ oc -n openshift-ingress delete services/router-default
```


If you delete the service, the Ingress Operator recreates it as External.
