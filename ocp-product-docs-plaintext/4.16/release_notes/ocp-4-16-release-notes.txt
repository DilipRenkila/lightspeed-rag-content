# About this release

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform (RHSA-2023:7198) is now available. This release uses Kubernetes 1.29 with CRI-O runtime. New features, changes, and known issues that pertain to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.16 are included in this topic.

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.16 clusters are available at https://console.redhat.com/openshift. With the Red Hat OpenShift Cluster Manager application for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, you can deploy Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform clusters to either on-premises or cloud environments.

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.16 is supported on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 8.8 and 8.9, and on Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) 4.15.

You must use RHCOS machines for the control plane, and you can use either RHCOS or RHEL for compute machines.

For Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.12 on x86_64 architecture, Red Hat has added a 6-month Extended Update Support (EUS) phase that extends the total available lifecycle from 18 months to 24 months. For Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.12 running on 64-bit ARM (aarch64), IBM Power&#174; (ppc64le), and IBM Z&#174; (s390x) architectures, the EUS lifecycle remains at 18 months.

Starting with Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.14, each EUS phase for even numbered releases on all supported architectures, including x86_64, 64-bit ARM (aarch64), IBM Power&#174; (ppc64le), and IBM Z&#174; (s390x) architectures, has a total available lifecycle of 24 months.

Starting with Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.14, Red Hat offers a 12-month additional EUS add-on, denoted as Additional EUS Term 2, that extends the total available lifecycle from 24 months to 36 months. The Additional EUS Term 2 is available on all architecture variants of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.

For more information about this support, see the Red Hat Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform Life Cycle Policy.

Maintenance support ends for version 4.12 on 25 January 2025 and goes to extended life phase. For more information, see the Red Hat Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform Life Cycle Policy.

Commencing with the 4.16 release, Red Hat is simplifying the administration and management of Red Hat shipped cluster Operators with the introduction of three new life cycle classifications; Platform Aligned, Platform Agnostic, and Rolling Stream. These life cycle classifications provide additional ease and transparency for cluster administrators to understand the life cycle policies of each Operator and form cluster maintenance and upgrade plans with predictable support boundaries. For more information, see OpenShift Operator Life Cycles.

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform is designed for FIPS. When running Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) or Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) booted in FIPS mode, Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform core components use the RHEL cryptographic libraries that have been submitted to NIST for FIPS 140-2/140-3 Validation on only the x86_64, ppc64le, and s390x architectures.

For more information about the NIST validation program, see Cryptographic Module Validation Program. For the latest NIST status for the individual versions of RHEL cryptographic libraries that have been submitted for validation, see Compliance Activities and Government Standards.

# Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform layered and dependent component support and compatibility

The scope of support for layered and dependent components of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform changes independently of the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform version. To determine the current support status and compatibility for an add-on, refer to its release notes. For more information, see the Red Hat Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform Life Cycle Policy.

# New features and enhancements

This release adds improvements related to the following components and concepts.

## Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS)

### RHCOS now uses RHEL 9.4

RHCOS now uses Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 9.4 packages in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.16. These packages ensure that your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform instances receive the latest fixes, features, enhancements, hardware support, and driver updates. As an Extended Update Support (EUS) release, Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.14 is excluded from this change and will continue to use RHEL 9.2 EUS packages for the entirety of its lifecycle.

### Support for iSCSI boot volumes

With this release, you can now install RHCOS to iSCSI boot devices. Multipathing for iSCSI is also supported. For more information, see Installing RHCOS manually on an iSCSI boot device and Installing RHCOS on an iSCSI boot device using iBFT

## Installation and update

### Optional cloud controller manager cluster capability

In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.16, you can disable the cloud controller manager capability during installation.
For more information, see Cloud controller manager capability.

### Optional additional tags for VMware vSphere

In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.16, you can add up to ten tags to attach to the VMs provisioned by a VMware vSphere cluster.
These tags are in addition to the unique cluster-specific tag that the installation program uses to identify and remove associated VMs when a cluster is decommissioned.

You can define the tags on the VMware vSphere VMs in the install-config.yaml file during cluster creation.
For more information, see Sample install-config.yaml file for an installer-provisioned VMware vSphere cluster.

You can define tags for compute or control plane machines on an existing cluster by using machine sets.
For more information, see "Adding tags to machines by using machine sets" for compute or control plane machine sets.

## Web console

### Administrator perspective

This release introduces the following updates to the Administrator perspective of the web console:

### Developer Perspective

This release introduces the following updates to the Developer perspective of the web console:

## OpenShift CLI (oc)

### Introducing the oc adm upgrade status command (Technology Preview)

Previously, the oc adm upgrade command provided limited information about the status of a cluster update. This release adds the oc adm upgrade status command, which decouples status information from the oc adm upgrade command and provides specific information regarding a cluster update, including the status of the control plane and worker node updates.

### Warning for duplicate resource short names

With this release, if you query a resource by using its short name, the OpenShift CLI  (oc) returns a warning if more than one custom resource definition (CRD) with the same short name exists in the cluster.


```terminal
Warning: short name "ex" could also match lower priority resource examples.test.com
```


### New flag to require confirmation when deleting resources (Technology Preview)

This release introduces a new --interactive flag for the oc delete command. When the --interactive flag is set to true, the resource is deleted only if the user confirms the deletion. This flag is available as a Technology Preview feature.

## IBM Z and IBM LinuxONE



## IBM Power



## Authentication and authorization



## Networking

### OpenShift SDN network plugin blocks future major upgrades

As part of the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform transition to OVN-Kubernetes as the only supported network plugin, starting with Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.16, if your cluster uses the OpenShift SDN network plugin, you cannot upgrade to future major versions of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform without migrating to OVN-Kubernetes. For more information about migrating to OVN-Kubernetes, see Migrating from the OpenShift SDN network plugin.

If you attempt an upgrade, the Cluster Network Operator reports the following status:


```yaml
- lastTransitionTime: "2024-04-11T05:54:37Z"
  message: Cluster is configured with OpenShiftSDN, which is not supported in the
    next version. Please follow the documented steps to migrate from OpenShiftSDN
    to OVN-Kubernetes in order to be able to upgrade. https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.16/networking/ovn_kubernetes_network_provider/migrate-from-openshift-sdn.html
  reason: OpenShiftSDNConfigured
  status: "False"
  type: Upgradeable
```


### Define multiple CIDR blocks for one network security group (NSG) rule

With this release, IP addresses and ranges are handled more efficiently in NSGs for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform clusters hosted on Azure. As a result, the maximum limit of CIDRs for all Ingress Controllers in Azure clusters, using the allowedSourceRanges field, increases from approximately 1000 to 4000 CIDRs.

### Migration from OpenShift SDN to OVN-Kubernetes on Nutanix

With this release, migration from the OpenShift SDN network plugin to OVN-Kubernetes is now supported on Nutanix platforms. For more information, see Migration to the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin.

### Improved integration between CoreDNS and egress firewall (Technology Preview)

With this release, OVN-Kubernetes uses a new DNSNameResolver custom resource to keep track of DNS records in your egress firewall rules, and is available as a Technology Preview. This custom resource supports the use of both wildcard DNS names and regular DNS names and allows access to DNS names regardless of the IP addresses associated with its change.

For more information, see Improved DNS resolution and resolving wildcard domain names.

### Parallel node draining during SR-IOV network policy updates

With this update, you can configure the SR-IOV Network Operator to drain nodes in parallel during network policy updates. The option to drain nodes in parallel enables faster rollouts of SR-IOV network configurations. You can use the SriovNetworkPoolConfig custom resource to configure parallel node draining and define the maximum number of nodes in the pool that the Operator can drain in parallel.

For further information, see Configuring parallel node draining during SR-IOV network policy updates.

### SR-IOV Network Operator no longer automatically creates the SriovOperatorConfig CR

As of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.16, the SR-IOV Network Operator no longer automatically creates a SriovOperatorConfig custom resource (CR). Create the SriovOperatorConfig CR using the procedure described in Configuring the SR-IOV Network Operator.

### Supporting double-tagged packets (QinQ)

This release introduces 802.1Q-in-802.1Q also known as QinQ support. QinQ introduces a second VLAN tag, where the service provider designates the outer tag for their use, offering them flexibility, while the inner tag remains dedicated to the customer’s VLAN. When two VLAN tags are present in a packet, the outer VLAN tag can be either 802.1Q or 802.1ad. The inner VLAN tag must always be 802.1Q.

For more information, see Configuring QinQ support for SR-IOV enabled workloads.

### Configuring a user-managed load balancer for on-premise infrastructure

With this release, you can configure an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster on any on-premise infrastructure, such as bare-metal, VMware vSphere, Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP), or Nutanix, to use a user-managed load balancer in place of the default load balancer. For this configuration, you must specify loadBalancer.type: UserManaged in your cluster’s install-config.yaml file.

For more information about this feature on bare-metal infrastructure, see Services for a user-managed load balancer in Setting up the environment for an OpenShift installation.

### Detect and warning for iptables

With this release, if you have pods in your cluster using iptables rules the following event message is given to warn against future deprecation:
This pod appears to have created one or more iptables rules. IPTables is deprecated and will no longer be available in RHEL 10 and later. You should consider migrating to another API such as nftables or eBPF.

For more information, see Getting started with nftables. If you are running third-party software, check with your vendor to ensure they will have an nftables based version available soon.

### Ingress network flows for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform services

With this release, you can view the ingress network flows for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform services. You can use this information to manage ingress traffic for your network and improve network security.

For more information, see Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform network flow matrix.

### Patching an existing dual-stack network

With this release, you can add IPv6 virtual IPs (VIPs) for API and Ingress services to an existing dual-stack-configured cluster by patching the cluster infrastructure.

If you have already upgraded your cluster to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.16 and you need to convert the single-stack cluster network to a dual-stack cluster network, you must specify the following for your cluster in the YAML configuration patch file:

* An IPv4 network for API and Ingress services on the first machineNetwork configuration.
* An IPv6 network for API and Ingress services on the second machineNetwork configuration.

For more information, see Converting to a dual-stack cluster network in Converting to IPv4/IPv6 dual-stack networking.

### Integration of MetalLB and FRR-K8s (Technology Preview)

This release introduces FRR-K8s, a Kubernetes based DaemonSet that exposes a subset of the FRR API in a Kubernetes-compliant manner.
As a cluster administrator, you can use the FRRConfiguration custom resource (CR) to configure the MetalLB Operator to use the FRR-K8s daemon set as the backend.
You can use this to operate FRR services, such as receiving routes.

For more information, see Configuring the integration of MetalLB and FRR-K8s.

## Registry



## Storage

### HashiCorp Vault is now available for the Secrets Store CSI Driver Operator (Technology Preview)

You can now use the Secrets Store CSI Driver Operator to mount secrets from HashiCorp Vault to a CSI volume in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform. The Secrets Store CSI Driver Operator is available as a Technology Preview feature.

For the full list of available secrets store providers, see Secrets store providers.

For information about using the Secrets Store CSI Driver Operator to mount secrets from HashiCorp Vault, see Mounting secrets from HashiCorp Vault.

### Volume cloning supported for Azure File (Technology Preview)

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.16 introduces volume cloning for the Microsoft Azure File Container Storage Interface (CSI) Driver Operator as a Technology Preview feature. Volume cloning duplicates an existing persistent volume (PV) to help protect against data loss in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform. You can also use a volume clone just as you would use any standard volume.

For more information, see Azure File CSI Driver Operator and CSI volume cloning.

### Node Expansion Secret is generally available

The Node Expansion Secret feature allows your cluster to expand storage of mounted volumes, even when access to those volumes requires a secret (for example, a credential for accessing a Storage Area Network (SAN) fabric) to perform the node expand operation. Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.16 supports this feature as generally available.

### Changing vSphere CSI maximum number of snapshots is generally available

The default maximum number of snapshots in VMWare vSphere Container Storage Interface (CSI) is 3 per volume. In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.16, you can now change this maximum number of snapshots to a maximum of 32 per volume. You also have granular control of the maximum number of snapshots for vSAN and Virtual Volume datastores. Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.16 supports this feature as generally available.

For more information, see Changing the maximum number of snapshots for vSphere.

### Persistent volume last phase transition time parameter (Technology Preview)

In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.16 introduces a new parameter, LastPhaseTransitionTime, which has a timestamp that is updated every time a persistent volume (PV) transitions to a different phase (pv.Status.Phase). This feature is being released with Technology Preview status.

### Persistent storage using CIFS/SMB CSI Driver Operator (Technology Preview)

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform is capable of provisioning persistent volumes (PVs) with a Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver for the Common Internet File System (CIFS) dialect/Server Message Block (SMB) protocol. The CIFS/SMB CSI Driver Operator that manages this driver is in Technology Preview status.

For more information, see CIFS/SMB CSI Driver Operator.

### RWOP with SELinux context mount is generally available

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.14 introduced a new access mode with Technical Preview status for persistent volumes (PVs) and persistent volume claims (PVCs) called ReadWriteOncePod (RWOP). RWOP can be used only in a single pod on a single node compared to the existing ReadWriteOnce access mode where a PV or PVC can be used on a single node by many pods. If the driver enables it, RWOP uses the SELinux context mount set in the PodSpec or container, which allows the driver to mount the volume directly with the correct SELinux labels. This eliminates the need to recursively relabel the volume, and pod startup can be significantly faster.

In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.16, this feature is generally available.

For more information, see Access modes.

### vSphere CSI Driver 3.1 updated CSI topology requirements

To support VMware vSphere Container Storage Interface (CSI) volume provisioning and usage in multi-zonal clusters, the deployment should match certain requirements imposed by CSI driver. These requirements have changed starting with 3.1.0, and although Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.16 accepts both the old and new tagging methods, you should use the new tagging method since VMware considers the old way an invalid configuration; thus to prevent problems, you should not use the old tagging method.

For more information, see vSphere CSI topology requirements.

## Builds



## Machine Config Operator

With this release, you can now garbage collect unused rendered machine configs. By using the oc adm prune renderedmachineconfigs command, you can view the unused rendered machine configs, determine which to remove, then batch delete the rendered machine configs you no longer need. Having too many machine configs can make working with the machine configs confusing and can also contribute to disk space and performance issues. For more information, see Managing unused rendered machine configs.

## Machine management

### Configuring expanders for the cluster autoscaler

With this release, the cluster autoscaler can use the LeastWaste, Priority, and Random expanders.
You can configure these expanders to influence the selection of machine sets when scaling the cluster.
For more information, see Configuring the cluster autoscaler.

### Managing machines with the Cluster API for VMware vSphere (Technology Preview)

This release introduces the ability to manage machines by using the upstream Cluster API, integrated into Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, as a Technology Preview for VMware vSphere clusters.
This capability is in addition or an alternative to managing machines with the Machine API.
For more information, see Managing machines with the Cluster API.

## Nodes

### Additional information collected by must-gather

With this release, the oc adm must-gather command collects the following additional information:

* OpenShift CLI (oc) binary version
* Must-gather logs

These additions help identify issues that might stem from using a specific version of oc. The oc adm must-gather command also lists what image was used and if any data could not be gathered in the must-gather logs.

For more information, see About the must-gather tool.

### Upgrading or downgrading host firmware

Beginning with Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.16, you can upgrade or downgrade the firmware for a bare-metal node to a specific version. Metal3 provides the HostFirmwareComponents resource, which describes BIOS and baseboard management controller (BMC) firmware versions. Upgrading or downgrading firmware is useful when deploying an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster on bare metal with validated patterns that have been tested against specific firmware versions. See About the HostFirmwareComponents resource for additional details.

### Editing the BareMetalHost resource

In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.16 and later, you can edit the baseboard management controller (BMC) address in the BareMetalHost resource of a bare-metal node. The node must be in the Provisioned, ExternallyProvisioned, Registering, or Available state. Editing the BMC address in the BareMetalHost resource will not result in deprovisioning the node. See Editing a BareMetalHost resource for additional details.

## Monitoring



## Network Observability Operator

The Network Observability Operator releases updates independently from the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform minor version release stream. Updates are available through a single, Rolling Stream which is supported on all currently supported versions of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4. Information regarding new features, enhancements, and bug fixes for the Network Observability Operator is found in the Network Observability release notes.

## Scalability and performance

### Workload partitioning enhancement

With this release, platform pods deployed with a workload annotation that includes both CPU limits and CPU requests will have the CPU limits accurately calculated and applied as a CPU quota for the specific pod. In prior releases, if a workload partitioned pod had both CPU limits and requests set, they were ignored by the webhook. The pod did not benefit from workload partitioning and was not locked down to specific cores. This update ensures the requests and limits are now interpreted correctly by the webhook.


[NOTE]
----
It is expected that if the values for CPU limits are different from the value for requests in the annotation, the CPU limits are taken as being the same as the requests.
----

For more information, see Workload partitioning.

### Linux Control Groups version 2 is now supported with the performance profile feature

Beginning with Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.16, Control Groups version 2 (cgroup v2), also known as cgroup2 or cgroupsv2, is enabled by default for all new deployments, even when performance profiles are present.

Since Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.14, cgroups v2 has been the default, but the performance profile feature required the use of cgroups v1. This issue has been resolved.

cgroup v1 is still used in upgraded clusters with performance profiles that have initial installation dates before Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.16. cgroup v1 can still be used in the current version by changing the cgroupMode field in the node.config object to v1.

For more information, see Configuring the Linux cgroup version on your nodes.

### Support for increasing the etcd database size (Technology Preview)

With this release, you can increase the disk quota in etcd. This is a Technology Preview feature. For more information, see Increasing the database size for etcd.

### Reserved core frequency tuning

With this release, the Node Tuning Operator supports setting CPU frequencies in the PerformanceProfile for reserved and isolated core CPUs.
This is an optional feature that you can use to define specific frequencies.
The Node Tuning Operator then sets those frequencies by enabling the intel_pstate CPUFreq driver in the Intel hardware.
You must follow Intel&#8217;s recommendations on frequencies for FlexRAN-like applications, which require the default CPU frequency to be set to a lower value than the default running frequency.

### Node Tuning Operator intel_pstate driver default setting

Previously, for the RAN DU-profile, setting the realTime workload hint to true in the PerformanceProfile always disabled the intel_pstate.
With this release, the Node Tuning Operator detects the underlying Intel hardware using TuneD and appropriately sets the intel_pstate kernel parameter based on the processor’s generation.
This decouples the intel_pstate from the realTime and highPowerConsumption workload hints.
The intel_pstate now depends only on the underlying processor generation.

For pre-IceLake processors, the intel_pstate is deactivated by default, whereas for IceLake and later generation processors, the intel_pstate is set to active.

## Edge computing

### TALM policy remediation

With this release, Topology Aware Lifecycle Manager (TALM) uses a Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management (RHACM) feature to remediate inform policies on managed clusters. This enhancement removes the need for the Operator to create enforce copies of inform policies during policy remediation. This enhancement also reduces the workload on the hub cluster due to copied policies, and can reduce the overall time required to remediate policies on managed clusters.

For more information, see Update policies on managed clusters.

# Notable technical changes

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.16 introduces the following notable technical changes.

## HAProxy version 2.8

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.16 uses HAProxy 2.8.

## SHA-1 certificates no longer supported for use with HAProxy

SHA-1 certificates are no longer supported for use with HAProxy. Both existing and new routes using SHA-1 certificates in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.16 are rejected and no longer function. For more information about creating secure routes, see Secured Routes.

## etcd tuning parameters

With this release, the etcd tuning parameters can be set to values that optimize performance and decrease latency, as follows.

* "" (Default)
* Standard
* Slower

## RHCOS dasd image artifacts no longer supported on IBM Z(R) and IBM(R) LinuxONE (s390x)

With this release, dasd image artifacts for the s390x architecture are removed from the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform image building pipeline. You can still use the metal4k image artifact, which is identical and contains the same functionality.

## Support for EgressIP with ExternalTrafficPolicy=Local services

Previously, it was unsupported for EgressIP selected pods to also serve as backends for services with externalTrafficPolicy set to Local. When attempting this configuration, service ingress traffic reaching the pods was incorrectly rerouted to the egress node hosting the EgressIP. This affected how responses to incoming service traffic connections were handled and led to non-functional services when externalTrafficPolicy was set to Local, as connections were dropped and the service became unavailable.

With Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.16, OVN-Kubernetes now supports the use of ExternalTrafficPolicy=Local services and EgressIP configurations at the same time on the same set of selected pods. OVN-Kubernetes now only reroutes the traffic originating from the EgressIP pods towards the egress node while routing the responses to ingress service traffic from the EgressIP pods via the same node where the pod is located.

## Operator API renamed to ClusterExtension

Earlier Technology Preview phases of Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) 1.0 introduced a new Operator API, provided as operator.operators.operatorframework.io by the Operator Controller component. In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.16, this API is renamed ClusterExtension, provided as clusterextension.olm.operatorframework.io, for this Technology Preview phase of OLM 1.0.

This API still streamlines management of installed extensions, which includes Operators via the registry+v1 bundle format, by consolidating user-facing APIs into a single object. The rename to ClusterExtension addresses the following:

* More accurately reflects the simplified functionality of extending a cluster's capabilities
* Better represents a more flexible packaging format
* Cluster prefix clearly indicates that ClusterExtension objects are cluster-scoped, a change from legacy OLM where Operators could be either namespace-scoped or cluster-scoped

## Legacy service account API token secrets are no longer generated for each service account

Prior to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.16, when the integrated OpenShift image registry was enabled, a legacy service account API token secret was generated for every service account in the cluster. Starting with Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.16, when the integrated OpenShift image registry is enabled, the legacy service account API token secret is no longer generated for each service account.

Additionally, when the integrated OpenShift image registry is enabled, the image pull secret generated for every service account no longer uses a legacy service account API token. Instead, the image pull secret now uses a bound service account token that is automatically refreshed before it expires.

For more information, see Automatically generated image pull secrets.

For information about detecting legacy service account API token secrets that are in use in your cluster or deleting them if they are not needed, see the Red Hat Knowledgebase article Long-lived service account API tokens in OpenShift Container Platform.

When Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 10 is released, systemd will not support booting in the cgroup v1 mode and only cgroup v2 mode will be available. As such, cgroup v1 is deprecated in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.16 and later. cgroup v1 will be removed in a future Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform release.

### Cluster Samples Operator

The Cluster Samples Operator is deprecated with the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.16 release. The Cluster Samples Operator will stop managing and providing support to the non-S2I samples (image streams and templates). No new templates, samples or non-Source-to-Image (Non-S2I) image streams will be added to the Cluster Samples Operator. However, the existing S2I builder image streams and templates will continue to receive updates until the Cluster Samples Operator is removed in a future release.

### Package-based RHEL compute machines

With this release, installation of package-based RHEL worker nodes is deprecated. In a subsequent future release, RHEL worker nodes will be removed and no longer supported.

RHCOS image layering will replace this feature and supports installing additional packages on the base operating system of your worker nodes.

For more information about image layering, see RHCOS image layering.

## Removed features

### Deprecated disk partition configuration method

The nodes.diskPartition section in the SiteConfig custom resource (CR) is deprecated with the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.16 release. It has been replaced with the ignitionConfigOverride method, which provides a more flexible way of creating a disk partition for any use case.

For more information, see Configuring disk partitioning with SiteConfig.

### Removal of platform Operators and plain bundles (Technology Preview)

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.16 removes platform Operators (Technology Preview) and plain bundles (Technology Preview), which were protoypes for Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) 1.0 (Technology Preview).

* The oc annotate command does not work for LDAP group names that contain an equal sign (=), because the command uses the equal sign as a delimiter between the annotation name and value. As a workaround, use oc patch or oc edit to add the annotation. (BZ#1917280)
* Run Once Duration Override Operator (RODOO) cannot be installed on clusters managed by the Hypershift Operator. (OCPBUGS-17533)
* For a bonding network interface that holds a br-ex bridge device, do not set the mode=6 balance-alb bond mode in a node network configuration. This bond mode is not supported on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform and it can cause the Open vSwitch (OVS) bridge device to disconnect from your networking environment. (OCPBUGS-34430).

# Asynchronous errata updates

Security, bug fix, and enhancement updates for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.16 are released as asynchronous errata through the Red Hat Network. All Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.16 errata is available on the Red Hat Customer Portal. See the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform Life Cycle for more information about asynchronous errata.

Red Hat Customer Portal users can enable errata notifications in the account settings for Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM). When errata notifications are enabled, users are notified through email whenever new errata relevant to their registered systems are released.


[NOTE]
----
Red Hat Customer Portal user accounts must have systems registered and consuming Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform entitlements for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform errata notification emails to generate.
----

This section will continue to be updated over time to provide notes on enhancements and bug fixes for future asynchronous errata releases of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.16. Versioned asynchronous releases, for example with the form Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.16.z, will be detailed in subsections. In addition, releases in which the errata text cannot fit in the space provided by the advisory will be detailed in subsections that follow.


[IMPORTANT]
----
For any Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform release, always review the instructions on updating your cluster properly.
