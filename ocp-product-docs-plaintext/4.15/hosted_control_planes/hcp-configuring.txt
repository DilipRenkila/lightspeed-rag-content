Amazon Web Services
Hosted control planes on the AWS platform is a Technology Preview feature only. Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete. Red Hat does not recommend using them in production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.

AWS infrastructure requirements: Review the infrastructure requirements to create a hosted cluster on AWS.

Configuring hosted control plane clusters on AWS: The tasks to configure hosted control plane clusters on AWS include creating the AWS S3 OIDC secret, creating a routable public zone, enabling external DNS, enabling AWS PrivateLink, and deploying a hosted cluster.

Deploying the SR-IOV Operator for hosted control planes: After you configure and deploy your hosting service cluster, you can create a subscription to the Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV) Operator on a hosted cluster. The SR-IOV pod runs on worker machines rather than the control plane.
