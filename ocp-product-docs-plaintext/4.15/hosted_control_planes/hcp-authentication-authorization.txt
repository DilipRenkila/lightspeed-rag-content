Authentication and authorization for hosted control planes

The "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" control plane includes a built-in OAuth server. You can obtain OAuth access tokens to authenticate to the "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" API. After you create your hosted cluster, you can configure OAuth by specifying an identity provider.
