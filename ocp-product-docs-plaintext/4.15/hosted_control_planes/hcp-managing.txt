Managing hosted control planes

After you configure your environment for hosted control planes and create a hosted cluster, you can further manage your clusters and nodes.
Scaling down the data plane to zero
If you are not using the hosted control plane, to save the resources and cost you can scale down a data plane to zero.

Ensure you are prepared to scale down the data plane to zero. Because the workload from the worker nodes disappears after scaling down.
Set the kubeconfig file to access the hosted cluster by running the following command:

Get the name of the NodePool resource associated to your hosted cluster by running the following command:

Optional: To prevent the pods from draining, add the nodeDrainTimeout field in the NodePool resource by running the following command:

Scale down the NodePool resource associated to your hosted cluster by running the following command:

Optional: Scale up the NodePool resource associated to your hosted cluster by running the following command:


Verify that the value for the nodeDrainTimeout field is greater than 0s by running the following command:
Deleting a hosted cluster
The steps to delete a hosted cluster differ depending on which provider you use.

If the cluster is on AWS, follow the instructions in Destroying a hosted cluster on AWS.

If the cluster is on bare metal, follow the instructions in Destroying a hosted cluster on bare metal.

If the cluster is on OpenShift Virtualization, follow the instructions in Destroying a hosted cluster on OpenShift Virtualization.
