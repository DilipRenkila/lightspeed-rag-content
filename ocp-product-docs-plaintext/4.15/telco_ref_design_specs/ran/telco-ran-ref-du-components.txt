Telco RAN DU "4.15" reference design components

The following sections describe the various "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" components and configurations that you use to configure and deploy clusters to run RAN DU workloads.
Host firmware tuning

New in this release

Description
Configure system level performance.
See Configuring host firmware for low latency and high performance for recommended settings.
Limits and requirements

Engineering considerations
Node Tuning Operator

New in this release

Description
You tune the cluster performance by creating a performance profile.
Settings that you configure with a performance profile include:
Limits and requirements
The Node Tuning Operator uses the PerformanceProfile CR to configure the cluster. You need to configure the following settings in the RAN DU profile PerformanceProfile CR:


You should not add additional workloads to the management partition. Only those pods which are part of the OpenShift management platform should be annotated into the management partition.

Engineering considerations



In "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" "4.15", any PerformanceProfile CR configured on the cluster causes the Node Tuning Operator to automatically set all cluster nodes to use cgroup v1.

For more information about cgroups, see Configuring Linux cgroup.
PTP Operator

New in this release

Description
Configure of PTP timing support for cluster nodes.
The DU node can run in the following modes:
Limits and requirements

Engineering considerations
SR-IOV Operator

New in this release

Description
The SR-IOV Operator provisions and configures the SR-IOV CNI and device plugins.
Both netdevice (kernel VFs) and vfio (DPDK) devices are supported.
Engineering considerations
Logging

New in this release

Description
Use logging to collect logs from the far edge node for remote analysis.
Engineering considerations
SRIOV-FEC Operator

New in this release

Description
SRIOV-FEC Operator is an optional 3rd party Certified Operator supporting FEC accelerator hardware.
Limits and requirements

Engineering considerations
Local Storage Operator

New in this release

Description
You can create persistent volumes that can be used as PVC resources by applications with the Local Storage Operator.
The number and type of PV resources that you create depends on your requirements.
Engineering considerations
LVMS Operator

New in this release

New in this release



LVMS Operator is an optional component.

Description
The LVMS Operator provides dynamic provisioning of block and file storage.
The LVMS Operator creates logical volumes from local devices that can be used as PVC resources by applications.
Volume expansion and snapshots are also possible.
Limits and requirements

Engineering considerations
Workload partitioning

New in this release

Description
Workload partitioning pins OpenShift platform and Day 2 Operator pods that are part of the DU profile to the reserved cpuset and removes the reserved CPU from node accounting.
This leaves all unreserved CPU cores available for user workloads.
Limits and requirements

Engineering considerations
Cluster tuning

New in this release

Description
The cluster capabilities feature now includes a MachineAPI component which, when excluded, disables the following Operators and their resources in the cluster:
Limits and requirements
Machine configuration

New in this release

Limits and requirements
Reference design deployment components
The following sections describe the various "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" components and configurations that you use to configure the hub cluster with Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management (RHACM).

Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management (RHACM)

New in this release

Description
RHACM provides Multi Cluster Engine (MCE) installation and ongoing lifecycle management functionality for deployed clusters.
You declaratively specify configurations and upgrades with Policy CRs and apply the policies to clusters with the RHACM policy controller as managed by Topology Aware Lifecycle Manager.
Limits and requirements

Engineering considerations
Topology Aware Lifecycle Manager (TALM)

New in this release

Description

Backup and restore for single-node OpenShift
TALM supports taking a snapshot of the cluster operating system and configuration to a dedicated partition on a local disk.
A restore script is provided that returns the cluster to the backed up state.
Limits and requirements

Engineering considerations
GitOps and GitOps ZTP plugins

New in this release

Description
GitOps and GitOps ZTP plugins provide a GitOps-based infrastructure for managing cluster deployment and configuration.
Cluster definitions and configurations are maintained as a declarative state in Git.
ZTP plugins provide support for generating installation CRs from the SiteConfig CR and automatic wrapping of configuration CRs in policies based on PolicyGenTemplate CRs.
Limits

Engineering considerations
Agent-based installer

New in this release

Description
Agent-based installer (ABI) provides installation capabilities without centralized infrastructure.
The installation program creates an ISO image that you mount to the server.
When the server boots it installs "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" and supplied extra manifests.


Agent-based installer (ABI) is an optional component.


Limits and requirements

Engineering considerations
Additional components
Bare Metal Event Relay
The Bare Metal Event Relay is an optional Operator that runs exclusively on the managed spoke cluster. It relays Redfish hardware events to cluster applications.

The Bare Metal Event Relay is not included in the RAN DU use model reference configuration and is an optional feature. If you want to use the Bare Metal Event Relay, assign additional CPU resources from the application CPU budget.
