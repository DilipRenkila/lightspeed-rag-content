Scheduling backups using Schedule CR

The schedule operation allows you to create a backup of your data at a particular time, specified by a Cron expression.

You schedule backups by creating a Schedule custom resource (CR) instead of a Backup CR.

Leave enough time in your backup schedule for a backup to finish before another backup is created.

For example, if a backup of a namespace typically takes 10 minutes, do not schedule backups more frequently than every 15 minutes.
You must install the OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) Operator.

The DataProtectionApplication CR must be in a Ready state.


Retrieve the backupStorageLocations CRs:

Create a Schedule CR, as in the following example:


cron expression to schedule the backup, for example, 0 7 * * * to perform a backup every day at 7:00.

Array of namespaces to back up.

Name of the backupStorageLocations CR.

Optional: In OADP version 1.2 and later, add the defaultVolumesToFsBackup: true key-value pair to your configuration when performing backups of volumes with Restic. In OADP version 1.1, add the defaultVolumesToRestic: true key-value pair when you back up volumes with Restic.
