OADP features and plugins

OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) features provide options for backing up and restoring applications.

The default plugins enable Velero to integrate with certain cloud providers and to back up and restore "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" resources.
OADP features
OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) supports the following features:


Backup
You can use OADP to back up all applications on the OpenShift Platform, or you can filter the resources by type, namespace, or label.
Restore
You can restore resources and PVs from a backup. You can restore all objects in a backup or filter the objects by namespace, PV, or label.
Schedule
You can schedule backups at specified intervals.
Hooks
You can use hooks to run commands in a container on a pod, for example, fsfreeze to freeze a file system. You can configure a hook to run before or after a backup or restore. Restore hooks can run in an init container or in the application container.
OADP plugins
The OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) provides default Velero plugins that are integrated with storage providers to support backup and snapshot operations. You can create custom plugins based on the Velero plugins.

OADP also provides plugins for "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" resource backups, OpenShift Virtualization resource backups, and Container Storage Interface (CSI) snapshots.


Mandatory.

Virtual machine disks are backed up with CSI snapshots or Restic.

The csi plugin uses the Kubernetes CSI snapshot API.

OADP 1.2 only.
About OADP Velero plugins
You can configure two types of plugins when you install Velero:

Default cloud provider plugins

Custom plugins


Both types of plugin are optional, but most users configure at least one cloud provider plugin.

Default Velero cloud provider plugins
You can install any of the following default Velero cloud provider plugins when you configure the oadp_v1alpha1_dpa.yaml file during deployment:

aws (Amazon Web Services)

gcp (Google Cloud Platform)

azure (Microsoft Azure)

openshift (OpenShift Velero plugin)

csi (Container Storage Interface)

kubevirt (KubeVirt)


You specify the desired default plugins in the oadp_v1alpha1_dpa.yaml file during deployment.

The following .yaml file installs the openshift, aws, azure, and gcp plugins:

 apiVersion: oadp.openshift.io/v1alpha1
 kind: DataProtectionApplication
 metadata:
   name: dpa-sample
 spec:
   configuration:
     velero:
       defaultPlugins:
       - openshift
       - aws
       - azure
       - gcp
Custom Velero plugins
You can install a custom Velero plugin by specifying the plugin image and name when you configure the oadp_v1alpha1_dpa.yaml file during deployment.

You specify the desired custom plugins in the oadp_v1alpha1_dpa.yaml file during deployment.

The following .yaml file installs the default openshift, azure, and gcp plugins and a custom plugin that has the name custom-plugin-example and the image quay.io/example-repo/custom-velero-plugin:

apiVersion: oadp.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: DataProtectionApplication
metadata:
 name: dpa-sample
spec:
 configuration:
   velero:
     defaultPlugins:
     - openshift
     - azure
     - gcp
     customPlugins:
     - name: custom-plugin-example
       image: quay.io/example-repo/custom-velero-plugin
Velero plugins returning "received EOF, stopping recv loop" message
Velero plugins are started as separate processes. After the Velero operation has completed, either successfully or not, they exit. Receiving a received EOF, stopping recv loop message in the debug logs indicates that a plugin operation has completed. It does not mean that an error has occurred.
Supported architectures for OADP
OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) supports the following architectures:

AMD64

ARM64

PPC64le

s390x


OADP 1.2.0 and later versions support the ARM64 architecture.
OADP support for IBM Power and IBM Z
OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) is platform neutral. The information that follows relates only to IBM Power&#174; and to IBM Z&#174;.

OADP 1.1.0 was tested successfully against "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" 4.11 for both IBM Power&#174; and IBM Z&#174;. The sections that follow give testing and support information for OADP 1.1.0 in terms of backup locations for these systems.

OADP support for target backup locations using IBM Power
IBM Power&#174; running with "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" 4.11 and 4.12, and OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) 1.1.2 was tested successfully against an AWS S3 backup location target. Although the test involved only an AWS S3 target, Red Hat supports running IBM Power&#174; with "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" 4.11 and 4.12, and OADP 1.1.2 against all non-AWS S3 backup location targets as well.
OADP testing and support for target backup locations using IBM Z
IBM Z&#174; running with "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" 4.11 and 4.12, and OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) 1.1.2 was tested successfully against an AWS S3 backup location target. Although the test involved only an AWS S3 target, Red Hat supports running IBM Z&#174; with "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" 4.11 and 4.12, and OADP 1.1.2 against all non-AWS S3 backup location targets as well.
OADP plugins known issues
The following section describes known issues in OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) plugins:

Velero plugin panics during imagestream backups due to a missing secret
When the backup and the Backup Storage Location (BSL) are managed outside the scope of the Data Protection Application (DPA), the OADP controller, meaning the DPA reconciliation does not create the relevant oadp-<bsl_name>-<bsl_provider>-registry-secret.

When the backup is run, the OpenShift Velero plugin panics on the imagestream backup, with the following panic error:

024-02-27T10:46:50.028951744Z time="2024-02-27T10:46:50Z" level=error msg="Error backing up item"
backup=openshift-adp/<backup name> error="error executing custom action (groupResource=imagestreams.image.openshift.io,
namespace=<BSL Name>, name=postgres): rpc error: code = Aborted desc = plugin panicked:
runtime error: index out of range with length 1, stack trace: goroutine 94â€¦
Workaround to avoid the panic error
To avoid the Velero plugin panic error, perform the following steps:

Label the custom BSL with the relevant label:

After the BSL is labeled, wait until the DPA reconciles.

When the DPA reconciles, confirm that the relevant oadp-<bsl_name>-<bsl_provider>-registry-secret has been created and that the correct registry data has been populated into it:
OpenShift ADP Controller segmentation fault
If you configure a DPA with both cloudstorage and restic enabled, the openshift-adp-controller-manager pod crashes and restarts indefinitely until the pod fails with a crash loop segmentation fault.

You can have either velero or cloudstorage defined, because they are mutually exclusive fields.

If you have both velero and  cloudstorage defined, the openshift-adp-controller-manager fails.

If you have neither velero nor cloudstorage defined, the openshift-adp-controller-manager fails.


For more information about this issue, see OADP-1054.

OpenShift ADP Controller segmentation fault workaround
You must define either velero or cloudstorage when you configure a DPA. If you define both APIs in your DPA, the openshift-adp-controller-manager pod fails with a crash loop segmentation fault.
