Backing up and restoring CSI snapshots data movement

You can back up and restore persistent volumes by using the OADP 1.3 Data Mover.
Backing up persistent volumes with CSI snapshots
You can use the OADP Data Mover to back up Container Storage Interface (CSI) volume snapshots to a remote object store.

You have access to the cluster with the cluster-admin role.

You have installed the OADP Operator.

You have included the CSI plugin and enabled the node agent in the DataProtectionApplication custom resource (CR).

You have an application with persistent volumes running in a separate namespace.

You have added the metadata.labels.velero.io/csi-volumesnapshot-class: "true" key-value pair to the VolumeSnapshotClass CR.


Create a YAML file for the Backup object, as in the following example:

Apply the manifest:


Verify that the snapshot data is successfully transferred to the remote object store by monitoring the status.phase field of the DataUpload CR.  Possible values are In Progress, Completed, Failed, or Canceled. The object store is configured in the backupLocations stanza of the DataProtectionApplication CR.
Restoring CSI volume snapshots
You can restore a volume snapshot by creating a Restore CR.

You cannot restore Volsync backups from OADP 1.2 with the OAPD 1.3 built-in Data Mover. It is recommended to do a file system backup of all of your workloads with Restic prior to upgrading to OADP 1.3.
You have access to the cluster with the cluster-admin role.

You have an OADP Backup CR from which to restore the data.


Create a YAML file for the Restore  CR, as in the following example:

Apply the manifest:


You can monitor the status of the restore process by checking the status.phase field of the DataDownload CR. Possible values are In Progress, Completed, Failed, or Canceled.
Deletion policy for OADP 1.3
The deletion policy determines rules for removing data from a system, specifying when and how deletion occurs based on factors such as retention periods, data sensitivity, and compliance requirements. It manages data removal effectively while meeting regulations and preserving valuable information.

Deletion policy guidelines for OADP 1.3
Review the following deletion policy guidelines for the OADP 1.3:

In OADP 1.3.x, when using any type of backup and restore methods, you can set the deletionPolicy field to Retain or Delete in the VolumeSnapshotClass custom resource (CR).
