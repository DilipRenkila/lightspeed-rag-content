# OADP 1.4.0 release notes

The OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) 1.4.0 release notes lists resolved issues and known issues.

## Resolved issues

Previously, while restoring the deleted application namespace, the restore operation partially failed with the resource name may not be empty error in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.16.
With this update, restore works as expected in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.16.
OADP-4075

Previously, Velero was using the earlier version of SDK where the Spec.SourceVolumeMode field did not exist. As a consequence, Data Mover backups failed in the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.16 cluster on the external snapshotter with v4.2 version.
With this update, external snapshotter is upgraded to v7.0 version and later. As a result, backups do not fail in the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.16 cluster.
OADP-3922

For a complete list of all issues resolved in this release, see the list of OADP 1.4.0 resolved issues in Jira.

## Known issues

While performing a backup of any application with Noobaa as the backup location, if the checksumAlgorithm configuration parameter is not set, backup fails. To fix this problem, if you do not provide a value for checksumAlgorithm in the Backup Storage Location (BSL) configuration, an empty value is added.
The empty value is only added for BSLs that are created using Data Protection Application (DPA) custom resource (CR), and this value is not added if BSLs are created using any other method.
OADP-4274

## Upgrade notes


[NOTE]
----
Always upgrade to the next minor version. Do not skip versions. To update to a later version, upgrade only one channel at a time. For example, to upgrade from OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) 1.1 to 1.3, upgrade first to 1.2, and then to 1.3.

### Changes from OADP 1.3 to 1.4

The Velero server has been updated from version 1.12 to 1.14. Note that, there are no changes in the Data Protection Application (DPA).

This changes the following:

* The velero-plugin-for-csi code is now available in the Velero code, which means no init container is needed for the plugin anymore.
* Velero changed client Burst and QPS defaults from 30 and 20 to 100 and 100 respectively.
* The velero-plugin-for-aws plugin updated default value of the spec.config.checksumAlgorithm field in BackupStorageLocations (BSLs) from "" (no checksum calculation) to the CRC32 algorithm. For more information, see Velero plugins for AWS Backup Storage Location. The checksum algorithm types are known to work only with AWS.
Several S3 providers require the md5sum to be disabled by setting the checksum algorithm to "". Confirm md5sum algorithm support and configuration with your storage provider.

In  OADP 1.4, the default value for BSLs created within DPA for this configuration is "". This default value means that the md5sum is not checked, which is consistent with OADP 1.3. For BSLs created within DPA, update it by using the spec.backupLocations[].velero.config.checksumAlgorithm field in the DPA. If your BSLs are created outside DPA, you can update this configuration by using spec.config.checksumAlgorithm in the BSLs.

### Backing up the DPA configuration

You must back up your current DataProtectionApplication (DPA) configuration.

* Save your current DPA configuration by running the following command:
Example

```terminal
$ oc get dpa -n openshift-adp -o yaml > dpa.orig.backup
```


### Upgrading the OADP Operator

Use the following procedure when upgrading the OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) Operator.

1. Change your subscription channel for the OADP Operator from stable-1.3 to stable-1.4.
2. Wait for the operator and containers to update and restart.

* Updating installed Operators

## Converting DPA to the new version

To upgrade from OADP 1.3 to 1.4, no Data Protection Application (DPA) changes are required.

## Verifying the upgrade

Verify the installation by following steps from the Verifying the upgrade section.
