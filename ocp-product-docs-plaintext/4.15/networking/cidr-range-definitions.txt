CIDR range definitions

You must specify non-overlapping ranges for the following CIDR ranges.

Machine CIDR ranges cannot be changed after creating your cluster.
OVN-Kubernetes, the default network provider in "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" 4.11 and later, uses the 100.64.0.0/16 IP address range internally. If your cluster uses OVN-Kubernetes, do not include the 100.64.0.0/16 IP address range in any other CIDR definitions in your cluster.
Machine CIDR
In the Machine CIDR field, you must specify the IP address range for machines or cluster nodes.

The default is 10.0.0.0/16. This range must not conflict with any connected networks.
Service CIDR
In the Service CIDR field, you must specify the IP address range for services. The range must be large enough to accommodate your workload. The address block must not overlap with any external service accessed from within the cluster. The default is 172.30.0.0/16.
Pod CIDR
In the pod CIDR field, you must specify the IP address range for pods.

The range must be large enough to accommodate your workload. The address block must not overlap with any external service accessed from within the cluster. The default is 10.128.0.0/14.
Host Prefix
In the Host Prefix field, you must specify the subnet prefix length assigned to pods scheduled to individual machines. The host prefix determines the pod IP address pool for each machine.
