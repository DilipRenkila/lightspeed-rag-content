Installing AWS Load Balancer Operator on a Security Token Service cluster

You can install the AWS Load Balancer (ALB) Operator on a Security Token Service (STS) cluster.

The ALB Operator relies on a CredentialsRequest to bootstrap the Operator and for the AWSLoadBalancerController instance. The ALB Operator waits until the required secrets are created and available.
Creating an IAM role for the AWS Load Balancer Operator
An additional IAM role is required to successfully install the ALB Operator on a Security Token Service (STS) cluster. The IAM role is required to interact with subnets and Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs). The Operator generates a CredentialsRequest with this role to bootstrap itself.

There are two options for creating the IAM role:

Using ccoctl and a predefined CredentialsRequest.

Using the AWS CLI and predefined AWS manifests.


Use the AWS CLI if your environment does not support the ccoctl command.

Using ccoctl to create an IAM role for the Operator
You can use the ccoctl binary to create an IAM role for the AWS Load Balancer (ALB) Operator. The created IAM role is used to interact with subnets and Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs).

You must extract and prepare the ccoctl binary.


Download the CredentialsRequest custom resource (CR) of the ALB Operator and create a directory to store it in by running the following command:

Use ccoctl to create an IAM role by running the following command:
Using the AWS CLI to create an IAM role for the Operator
You can use the aws command line interface to create an IAM role for the AWS Load Balancer (ALB) Operator. The created IAM role is used to interact with subnets and Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs).

You must have access to the aws command line interface.


Generate a trust policy file using your identity provider by running the following command:

Create the IAM role with the generated trust policy by running the following command:

Download the permission policy for the ALB Operator by running the following command:

Attach the permission policy for the AWSLoadBalancerController to the IAM role by running the following command:
Specifying the role ARN for the ALB Operator on an STS cluster
The role Amazon Resource Name (ARN) needs to be passed to the AWS Load Balancer (ALB) Operator as an environment variable. You can use the dedicated input box in the OperatorHub web UI or specify it in the Subscription resource when installing the Operator by using the OpenShift CLI.

You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).


Create the aws-load-balancer-operator project by running the following command:

Create an OperatorGroup for the ALB Operator by running the following command:

Create a Subscription object for the ALB Operator with the role ARN by running the following command:
Creating an IAM role for the AWS Load Balancer Controller
The CredentialsRequest for the AWS Load Balancer Controller must be set with a manually provisioned IAM role.

There are two options for creating the IAM role:

Using ccoctl and a predefined CredentialsRequest.

Using the AWS CLI and predefined AWS manifests.


Use the AWS CLI if your environment does not support the ccoctl command.

Using ccoctl to create an IAM role for the Controller
You can use the ccoctl binary to create an IAM role for the AWSLoadBalancerController. The created IAM role is used to interact with subnets and Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs).

You must extract and prepare the ccoctl binary.


Download the CredentialsRequest custom resource (CR) of the AWS Load Balancer Operator and create a directory to store it in by running the following command:

Use ccoctl to create an IAM role by running the following command:
Using the AWS CLI to create an IAM role for the Controller

Create the IAM role with the generated trust policy by running the following command:

Download the permission policy for the AWSLoadBalancerController by running the following command:

Attach the permission policy for the AWSLoadBalancerController to the IAM role by running the following command:

Create an AWSLoadBalancerController resource file named example-sts-iam-role.yaml with contents such as the following example:
