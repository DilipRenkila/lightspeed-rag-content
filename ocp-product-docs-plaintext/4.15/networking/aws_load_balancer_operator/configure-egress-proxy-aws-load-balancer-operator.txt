Configuring cluster-wide proxy

You can configure the cluster-wide proxy in the AWS Load Balancer Operator. After configuring the cluster-wide proxy, Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) automatically updates all the deployments of the Operators with the environment variables such as HTTP_PROXY, HTTPS_PROXY, and NO_PROXY. These variables are populated to the managed controller by the AWS Load Balancer Operator.
Trusting the certificate authority of the cluster-wide proxy
Create the config map to contain the certificate authority (CA) bundle in the aws-load-balancer-operator namespace by running the following command:

To inject the trusted CA bundle into the config map, add the config.openshift.io/inject-trusted-cabundle=true label to the config map by running the following command:

Update the AWS Load Balancer Operator subscription to access the config map in the AWS Load Balancer Operator deployment by running the following command:

After the AWS Load Balancer Operator is deployed, verify that the CA bundle is added to the aws-load-balancer-operator-controller-manager deployment by running the following command:

Optional: Restart deployment of the AWS Load Balancer Operator every time the config map changes by running the following command:
