Accessing faster builds with /dev/fuse

You can configure your pods with the /dev/fuse device to access faster builds.
Configuring /dev/fuse on unprivileged pods
As an alternative to the virtual filesystem, you can configure the /dev/fuse device to the io.kubernetes.cri-o.Devices annotation to access faster builds within unprivileged pods. Using /dev/fuse is secure, efficient, and scalable, and allows unprivileged users to mount an overlay filesystem as if the unprivileged pod was privileged.

Create the pod.

Implement /dev/fuse by adding the /dev/fuse device to the io.kubernetes.cri-o.Devices annotation.

Configure the /dev/fuse device in your pod specifications.
