Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator release notes

The release notes for the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator for Red Hat OpenShift describe new features and enhancements, deprecated features, and known issues.

The Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator uses the Kubernetes-based Event Driven Autoscaler (KEDA) and is built on top of the "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" horizontal pod autoscaler (HPA).

The Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator for Red Hat OpenShift is provided as an installable component, with a distinct release cycle from the core "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform". The Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform Life Cycle Policy outlines release compatibility.
Supported versions
The following table defines the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator versions for each "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" version.
Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator 2.12.1-376 release notes
This release of the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator 2.12.1-376 provides security updates and bug fixes for running the Operator in an "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" cluster. The following advisory is available for the RHSA-2024:1812.

Before installing this version of the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator, remove any previously installed Technology Preview versions or the community-supported version of KEDA.
Bug fixes
Previously, if invalid values, such as nonexistent namespaces, were specified in scaled object metadata, the underlying scaler clients would not free, or close, their client descriptors, resulting in a slow memory leak. This fix properly closes the underlying client descriptors when there are errors, preventing memory from leaking. (OCPBUGS-30145)

Previously the ServiceMonitor custom resource (CR) for the keda-metrics-apiserver pod was not functioning, because the CR referenced an incorrect metrics port name of http. This fix corrects the ServiceMonitor CR to reference the proper port name of metrics. As a result, the Service Monitor functions properly. (OCPBUGS-25806)
