# OpenShift Lightspeed overview



Red Hat OpenShift Lightspeed provides intelligent, natural language processing capabilities designed to make Red Hat cloud-native application platforms easier to use for novice users and more efficient for experienced professionals.


[NOTE]
----
Because OpenShift Lightspeed releases on a different cadence from Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, the OpenShift Lightspeed documentation is available as a separate documentation set.
The OpenShift Lightspeed documentation is available at https://docs.openshift.com/lightspeed/1.0tp1/about/ols-about-openshift-lightspeed.html
