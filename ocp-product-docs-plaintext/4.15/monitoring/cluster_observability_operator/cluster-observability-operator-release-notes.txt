The Cluster Observability Operator (COO) is an optional "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" Operator that enables administrators to create standalone monitoring stacks that are independently configurable for use by different services and users.

The COO complements the built-in monitoring capabilities of "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform". You can deploy it in parallel with the default platform and user workload monitoring stacks managed by the Cluster Monitoring Operator (CMO).
