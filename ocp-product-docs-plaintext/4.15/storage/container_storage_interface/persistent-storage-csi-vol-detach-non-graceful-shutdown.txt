Detach CSI volumes after non-graceful node shutdown

This feature allows Container Storage Interface (CSI) drivers to automatically detach volumes when a node goes down non-gracefully.
Overview
A graceful node shutdown occurs when the kubelet's node shutdown manager detects the upcoming node shutdown action. Non-graceful shutdowns occur when the kubelet does not detect a node shutdown action, which can occur because of system or hardware failures. Also, the kubelet may not detect a node shutdown action when the shutdown command does not trigger the Inhibitor Locks mechanism used by the kubelet on Linux, or because of a user error, for example, if the shutdownGracePeriod and shutdownGracePeriodCriticalPods details are not configured correctly for that node.

With this feature, when a non-graceful node shutdown occurs, you can manually add an out-of-service taint on the node to allow volumes to automatically detach from the node.

Access to the cluster with cluster-admin privileges.


To allow volumes to detach automatically from a node after a non-graceful node shutdown:

After a node is detected as unhealthy, shut down the worker node.

Ensure that the node is shutdown by running the following command and checking the status:

Taint the corresponding node object by running the following command:

Restart the node.

Remove the taint.
