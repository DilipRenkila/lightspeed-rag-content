Release notes for Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform 3.1.1

Distributed tracing overview
As a service owner, you can use distributed tracing to instrument your services to gather insights into your service architecture. You can use the Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform for monitoring, network profiling, and troubleshooting the interaction between components in modern, cloud-native, microservices-based applications.

With the distributed tracing platform, you can perform the following functions:

Monitor distributed transactions

Optimize performance and latency

Perform root cause analysis


The distributed tracing platform consists of three components:

Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform (Tempo), which is based on the open source Grafana Tempo project.

Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry, which is based on the open source OpenTelemetry project.

Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform (Jaeger), which is based on the open source Jaeger project.
Component versions in the Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform 3.1.1

CVEs
This release fixes CVE-2023-39326.
Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform (Tempo)
Known issues
There are currently known issues:

Currently, when used with the Tempo Operator, the Jaeger UI only displays services that have sent traces in the last 15 minutes. For services that did not send traces in the last 15 minutes, traces are still stored but not displayed in the Jaeger UI. (TRACING-3139)

Currently, the distributed tracing platform (Tempo) fails on the IBM Z (s390x) architecture. (TRACING-3545)

Support for OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator
Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) 3.1.1 is supported for use with the OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator 5.6, 5.7, and 5.8.
Deprecated functionality
In the Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform 3.1.1, Jaeger and support for Elasticsearch remain deprecated, and both are planned to be removed in a future release. Red Hat will provide critical and above CVE bug fixes and support for these components during the current release lifecycle, but these components will no longer receive feature enhancements.

In the Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform 3.1.1, Tempo provided by the Tempo Operator and the OpenTelemetry Collector provided by the Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry are the preferred Operators for distributed tracing collection and storage. The OpenTelemetry and Tempo distributed tracing stack is to be adopted by all users because this will be the stack that will be enhanced going forward.
Known issues
There are currently known issues:

Currently, Apache Spark is not supported.

Currently, the streaming deployment via AMQ/Kafka is not supported on the IBM Z and IBM Power architectures.

Making open source more inclusive
Red Hat is committed to replacing problematic language in our code, documentation, and web properties. We are beginning with these four terms: master, slave, blacklist, and whitelist. Because of the enormity of this endeavor, these changes will be implemented gradually over several upcoming releases. For more details, see our CTO Chris Wright's message.
