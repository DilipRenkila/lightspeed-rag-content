* RHEA-2024:1534 Cluster Observability Operator 0.1.2

## CVEs

* CVE-2023-45142

## Bug fixes

* Previously, certain cluster service version (CSV) annotations were not included in the metadata for COO.
Because of these missing annotations, certain COO features and capabilities did not appear in the package manifest or in the OperatorHub user interface.
This release adds the missing annotations, thereby resolving this issue. (COO-11)
* Previously, automatic updates of the COO did not work, and a newer version of the Operator did not automatically replace the older version, even though the newer version was available in OperatorHub.

* Previously, Thanos Querier only listened for network traffic on port 9090 of 127.0.0.1 (localhost), which resulted in a 502 Bad Gateway error if you tried to reach the Thanos Querier service.
With this release, the Thanos Querier configuration has been updated so that the component now listens on the default port (10902), thereby resolving the issue.
As a result of this change, you can also now modify the port via server side apply (SSA) and add a proxy chain, if required. (COO-14)
