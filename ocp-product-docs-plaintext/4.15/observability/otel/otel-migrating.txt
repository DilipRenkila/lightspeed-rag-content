Migrating from the distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) to the Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry

The Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) is a deprecated feature. Deprecated functionality is still included in "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" and continues to be supported; however, it will be removed in a future release of this product and is not recommended for new deployments.

For the most recent list of major functionality that has been deprecated or removed within "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform", refer to the Deprecated and removed features section of the "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" release notes.
If you are already using the Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) for your applications, you can migrate to the Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry, which is based on the OpenTelemetry open-source project.

The Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry provides a set of APIs, libraries, agents, and instrumentation to facilitate observability in distributed systems. The OpenTelemetry Collector in the Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry can ingest the Jaeger protocol, so you do not need to change the SDKs in your applications.

Migration from the distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) to the Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry requires configuring the OpenTelemetry Collector and your applications to report traces seamlessly. You can migrate sidecar and sidecarless deployments.
Migrating from the distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) to the Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry with sidecars
The Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry Operator supports sidecar injection into deployment workloads, so you can migrate from a distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) sidecar to a Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry sidecar.

The Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) is used on the cluster.

The Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry is installed.


Configure the OpenTelemetry Collector as a sidecar.

Create a service account for running your application.

Create a cluster role for the permissions needed by some processors.

Create a ClusterRoleBinding to set the permissions for the service account.

Deploy the OpenTelemetry Collector as a sidecar.

Remove the injected Jaeger Agent from your application by removing the "sidecar.jaegertracing.io/inject": "true" annotation from your Deployment object.

Enable automatic injection of the OpenTelemetry sidecar by adding the sidecar.opentelemetry.io/inject: "true" annotation to the .spec.template.metadata.annotations field of your Deployment object.

Use the created service account for the deployment of your application to allow the processors to get the correct information and add it to your traces.
Migrating from the distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) to the Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry without sidecars
You can migrate from the distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) to the Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry without sidecar deployment.

The Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) is used on the cluster.

The Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry is installed.


Configure OpenTelemetry Collector deployment.

Create the project where the OpenTelemetry Collector will be deployed.

Create a service account for running the OpenTelemetry Collector instance.

Create a cluster role for setting the required permissions for the processors.

Create a ClusterRoleBinding to set the permissions for the service account.

Create the OpenTelemetry Collector instance.

Point your tracing endpoint to the OpenTelemetry Operator.

If you are exporting your traces directly from your application to Jaeger, change the API endpoint from the Jaeger endpoint to the OpenTelemetry Collector endpoint.
