# Processors


Processors process the data between it is received and exported. Processors are optional. By default, no processors are enabled. Processors must be enabled for every data source. Not all processors support all data sources. Depending on the data source, multiple processors might be enabled. Note that the order of processors matters.

# Batch Processor

The Batch Processor batches traces and metrics to reduce the number of outgoing connections needed to transfer the telemetry information.


```yaml
# ...
  config: |
    processor:
      batch:
        timeout: 5s
        send_batch_max_size: 10000
    service:
      pipelines:
        traces:
          processors: [batch]
        metrics:
          processors: [batch]
# ...
```




# Memory Limiter Processor

The Memory Limiter Processor periodically checks the Collector&#8217;s memory usage and pauses data processing when the soft memory limit is reached. This processor supports traces, metrics, and logs. The preceding component, which is typically a receiver, is expected to retry sending the same data and may apply a backpressure to the incoming data. When memory usage exceeds the hard limit, the Memory Limiter Processor forces garbage collection to run.


```yaml
# ...
  config: |
    processor:
      memory_limiter:
        check_interval: 1s
        limit_mib: 4000
        spike_limit_mib: 800
    service:
      pipelines:
        traces:
          processors: [batch]
        metrics:
          processors: [batch]
# ...
```




# Resource Detection Processor

The Resource Detection Processor identifies host resource details in alignment with OpenTelemetry&#8217;s resource semantic standards. Using the detected information, this processor can add or replace the resource values in telemetry data. This processor supports traces and metrics. You can use this processor with multiple detectors such as the Docket metadata detector or the OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES environment variable detector.

# ...
```


Specifies which detector to use. In this example, the environment detector is specified.

# Attributes Processor

The Attributes Processor can modify attributes of a span, log, or metric. You can configure this processor to filter and match input data and include or exclude such data for specific actions.

This processor operates on a list of actions, executing them in the order specified in the configuration. The following actions are supported:

Insert:: Inserts a new attribute into the input data when the specified key does not already exist.
Update:: Updates an attribute in the input data if the key already exists.
Upsert:: Combines the insert and update actions: Inserts a new attribute if the key does not exist yet. Updates the attribute if the key already exists.
Delete:: Removes an attribute from the input data.
Hash:: Hashes an existing attribute value as SHA1.
Extract:: Extracts values by using a regular expression rule from the input key to the target keys defined in the rule. If a target key already exists, it is overridden similarly to the Span Processor's to_attributes setting with the existing attribute as the source.
Convert:: Converts an existing attribute to a specified type.


```yaml
# ...
  config: |
    processors:
      attributes/example:
        actions:
          - key: db.table
            action: delete
          - key: redacted_span
            value: true
            action: upsert
          - key: copy_key
            from_attribute: key_original
            action: update
          - key: account_id
            value: 2245
            action: insert
          - key: account_password
            action: delete
          - key: account_email
            action: hash
          - key: http.status_code
            action: convert
            converted_type: int
# ...
```


# Resource Processor

The Resource Processor applies changes to the resource attributes. This processor supports traces, metrics, and logs.

```yaml
# ...
  config: |
    processor:
      attributes:
      - key: cloud.availability_zone
        value: "zone-1"
        action: upsert
      - key: k8s.cluster.name
        from_attribute: k8s-cluster
        action: insert
      - key: redundant-attribute
        action: delete
# ...
```


Attributes represent the actions that are applied to the resource attributes, such as delete the attribute, insert the attribute, or upsert the attribute.

# Span Processor

The Span Processor modifies the span name based on its attributes or extracts the span attributes from the span name. This processor can also change the span status and include or exclude spans. This processor supports traces.

Span renaming requires specifying attributes for the new name by using the from_attributes configuration.

```yaml
# ...
  config: |
    processor:
      span:
        name:
          from_attributes: [<key1>, <key2>, ...] 1
          separator: <value> 2
# ...
```


Defines the keys to form the new span name.
An optional separator.

You can use this processor to extract attributes from the span name.


```yaml
# ...
  config: |
    processor:
      span/to_attributes:
        name:
          to_attributes:
            rules:
              - ^\/api\/v1\/document\/(?P<documentId>.*)\/update$ 1
# ...
```


This rule defines how the extraction is to be executed. You can define more rules: for example, in this case, if the regular expression matches the name, a documentID attibute is created. In this example, if the input span name is /api/v1/document/12345678/update, this results in the /api/v1/document/{documentId}/update output span name, and a new "documentId"="12345678" attribute is added to the span.

You can have the span status modified.


```yaml
# ...
  config: |
    processor:
      span/set_status:
        status:
          code: Error
          description: "<error_description>"
# ...
```


# Kubernetes Attributes Processor

The Kubernetes Attributes Processor enables automatic configuration of spans, metrics, and log resource attributes by using the Kubernetes metadata.
This processor supports traces, metrics, and logs.
This processor automatically identifies the Kubernetes resources, extracts the metadata from them, and incorporates this extracted metadata as resource attributes into relevant spans, metrics, and logs. It utilizes the Kubernetes API to discover all pods operating within a cluster, maintaining records of their IP addresses, pod UIDs, and other relevant metadata.

                 node_from_env_var: KUBE_NODE_NAME
# ...
```


# Filter Processor

The Filter Processor leverages the OpenTelemetry Transformation Language to establish criteria for discarding telemetry data. If any of these conditions are satisfied, the telemetry data are discarded. You can combine the conditions by using the logical OR operator. This processor supports traces, metrics, and logs.

  processors:
    filter/ottl:
      error_mode: ignore 1
      traces:
        span:
          - 'attributes["container.name"] == "app_container_1"' 2
          - 'resource.attributes["host.name"] == "localhost"' 3
# ...
```


Defines the error mode. When set to ignore, ignores errors returned by conditions. When set to propagate, returns the error up the pipeline. An error causes the payload to be dropped from the Collector.
Filters the spans that have the container.name == app_container_1 attribute.
Filters the spans that have the host.name == localhost resource attribute.

# Routing Processor

The Routing Processor routes logs, metrics, or traces to specific exporters. This processor can read a header from an incoming gRPC or plain HTTP request or read a resource attribute, and then direct the trace information to relevant exporters according to the read value.

```yaml
# ...
config: |
  processors:
    routing:
      from_attribute: X-Tenant 1
      default_exporters: 2
      - jaeger
      table: 3
      - value: acme
        exporters: [jaeger/acme]
  exporters:
    jaeger:
      endpoint: localhost:14250
    jaeger/acme:
      endpoint: localhost:24250
# ...
```


The HTTP header name for the lookup value when performing the route.
The default exporter when the attribute value is not present in the table in the next section.
The table that defines which values are to be routed to which exporters.

You can optionally create an attribute_source configuration, which defines where to look for the attribute in from_attribute. The allowed value is context to search the context, which includes the HTTP headers, or resource to search the resource attributes.

# Cumulative to Delta Processor

This processor converts monotonic, cumulative-sum, and histogram metrics to monotonic delta metrics.

You can filter metrics by using the include: or exclude: fields and specifying the strict or regexp metric name matching.

This processor does not convert non-monotonic sums and exponential histograms.

        match_type: regexp
        metrics:
        - "<regular_expression_for_metric_names>"
# ...
```


Optional: Configures which metrics to include. When omitted, all metrics, except for those listed in the exclude field, are converted to delta metrics.
Defines a value provided in the metrics field as a strict exact match or regexp regular expression.
Lists the metric names, which are exact matches or matches for regular expressions, of the metrics to be converted to delta metrics. If a metric matches both the include and exclude filters, the exclude filter takes precedence.
Optional: Configures which metrics to exclude. When omitted, no metrics are excluded from conversion to delta metrics.
