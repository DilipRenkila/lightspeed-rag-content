Filtering logs by metadata

You can filter logs in the ClusterLogForwarder CR to select or ignore an entire log stream based on the metadata by using the input selector. As an administrator or developer, you can include or exclude the log collection to reduce the memory and CPU load on the collector.

You can use this feature only if the Vector collector is set up in your logging deployment.
input spec filtering is different from content filtering. input selectors select or ignore entire log streams based on the source metadata. Content filters edit the log streams to remove and modify the records based on the record content.
