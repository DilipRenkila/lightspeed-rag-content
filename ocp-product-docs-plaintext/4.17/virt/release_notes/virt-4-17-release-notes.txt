# About Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization

With Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization, you can bring traditional virtual machines (VMs) into Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform and run them alongside containers. In OpenShift Virtualization, VMs are native Kubernetes objects that you can manage by using the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console or the command line.

OpenShift Virtualization is represented by the  icon.

You can use OpenShift Virtualization the OVN-Kubernetes Container Network Interface (CNI) network provider.

Prepare your cluster for OpenShift Virtualization.

## OpenShift Virtualization supported cluster version

OpenShift Virtualization 4.16 is supported for use on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.17 clusters. To use the latest z-stream release of OpenShift Virtualization, you must first upgrade to the latest version of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.

## Supported guest operating systems

To view the supported guest operating systems for OpenShift Virtualization, see Certified Guest Operating Systems in Red Hat OpenStack Platform, Red Hat Virtualization, OpenShift Virtualization and Red Hat Enterprise Linux with KVM.

## Microsoft Windows SVVP certification

OpenShift Virtualization is certified in Microsoft&#8217;s Windows Server Virtualization Validation Program (SVVP) to run Windows Server workloads.

The SVVP certification applies to:

* Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS workers. In the Microsoft SVVP Catalog, they are named Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4 on RHEL CoreOS 9.
* Intel and AMD CPUs.

# Quick starts

Quick start tours are available for several OpenShift Virtualization features. To view the tours, click the Help icon ? in the menu bar on the header of the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console and then select Quick Starts. You can filter the available tours by entering the keyword virtualization in the Filter field.

# Deprecated and removed features

## Deprecated features

Deprecated features are included in the current release and supported. However, they will be removed in a future release and are not recommended for new deployments.

* The tekton-tasks-operator is deprecated and Tekton tasks and example pipelines are now deployed by the ssp-operator.

* The copy-template, modify-vm-template, and create-vm-from-template tasks are deprecated.

* Support for Windows Server 2012 R2 templates is deprecated.

* The alerts KubeVirtComponentExceedsRequestedMemory and KubeVirtComponentExceedsRequestedCPU are deprecated. You can safely silence them.

## Removed features

Removed features are not supported in the current release.

# Technology Preview features

Some features in this release are currently in Technology Preview. These experimental features are not intended for production use. Note the following scope of support on the Red Hat Customer Portal for these features:

Technology Preview Features Support Scope

* You can now configure a VM eviction strategy for the entire cluster.

* You can now enable nested virtualization on OpenShift Virtualization hosts.

* Cluster admins can now enable CPU resource limits on a namespace in the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console under Overview -> Settings -> Preview features.

* Cluster admins can now use the wasp-agent tool to configure a higher VM workload density in their clusters by overcommitting the amount of memory, in RAM, and assigning swap resources to VM workloads.

* OpenShift Virtualization now supports compatibility with Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation (ODF) Regional Disaster Recovery.

# Bug fixes



# Known issues

## Monitoring

## Networking

## Nodes

* Uninstalling OpenShift Virtualization does not remove the feature.node.kubevirt.io node labels created by OpenShift Virtualization. You must remove the labels manually. (CNV-38543)

* In a heterogeneous cluster with different compute nodes, virtual machines that have HyperV reenlightenment enabled cannot be scheduled on nodes that do not support timestamp-counter scaling (TSC) or have the appropriate TSC frequency. (BZ#2151169)

## Storage

* If you clone more than 100 VMs using the csi-clone cloning strategy, then the Ceph CSI might not purge the clones. Manually deleting the clones might also fail. (CNV-23501)
* As a workaround, you can restart the ceph-mgr to purge the VM clones.

## Virtualization

* VM migrations might fail on clusters with mixed CPU types. (CNV-43195)
* As a workaround, you can set the CPU model at the VM spec level or at the cluster level.

* When adding a virtual Trusted Platform Module (vTPM) device to a Windows VM, the BitLocker Drive Encryption system check passes even if the vTPM device is not persistent. This is because a vTPM device that is not persistent stores and recovers encryption keys using ephemeral storage for the lifetime of the virt-launcher pod. When the VM migrates or is shut down and restarts, the vTPM data is lost. (CNV-36448)

* OpenShift Virtualization links a service account token in use by a pod to that specific pod. OpenShift Virtualization implements a service account volume by creating a disk image that contains a token. If you migrate a VM, then the service account volume becomes invalid. (CNV-33835)
* As a workaround, use user accounts rather than service accounts because user account tokens are not bound to a specific pod.

## Web console

* When you create a persistent volume claim (PVC) by selecting With Data upload form from the Create PersistentVolumeClaim list in the web console, uploading data to the PVC by using the Upload Data field fails. (CNV-37607)
