# About catalogs in OLM v1

You can discover installable content by querying a catalog for Kubernetes extensions, such as Operators and controllers, by using the catalogd component. Catalogd is a Kubernetes extension that unpacks catalog content for on-cluster clients and is part of the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) v1 suite of microservices. Currently, catalogd unpacks catalog content that is packaged and distributed as container images.

----
If you try to install an Operator or extension that does not have unique name, the installation might fail or lead to an unpredictable result. This occurs for the following reasons:
* If mulitple catalogs are installed on a cluster, Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) v1 does not include a mechanism to specify a catalog when you install an Operator or extension.
* OLM v1 requires that all of the Operators and extensions that are available to install on a cluster use a unique name for their bundles and packages.

* File-based catalogs
* Adding a catalog to a cluster
* Red Hat-provided catalogs
