# Destroying a hosted cluster on IBM Z


You can destroy a hosted cluster on x86 bare metal with IBM Z compute nodes and its managed cluster resource by using the command-line interface (CLI).

# Destroying a hosted cluster on x86 bare metal with IBM Z compute nodes

To destroy a hosted cluster and its managed cluster on x86 bare metal with IBM Z compute nodes, you can use the command-line interface (CLI).

1. Scale the NodePool object to 0 nodes by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc -n <hosted_cluster_namespace> scale nodepool <nodepool_name> --replicas 0
```


[IMPORTANT]
----
If the compute nodes are not detached from the hosted cluster or are stuck in the Notready state, delete the compute nodes manually by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc --kubeconfig <hosted_cluster_name>.kubeconfig delete node <compute_node_name>
```

----
2. Verify the status of the compute nodes by entering the following command:

```terminal
$ oc --kubeconfig <hosted_cluster_name>.kubeconfig get nodes
```


After the compute nodes are detached from the hosted cluster, the status of the agents is changed to auto-assign.
3. Delete the agents from the cluster by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc -n <hosted_control_plane_namespace> delete agent <agent_name>
```


[NOTE]
----
You can delete the virtual machines that you created as agents after you delete the agents from the cluster.
----
4. Destroy the hosted cluster by running the following command:

```terminal
$ hcp destroy cluster agent --name <hosted_cluster_name> --namespace <hosted_cluster_namespace>
```
